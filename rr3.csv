Although a review of evidence found that improved road / street lighting was associated with reductions in crime, these reductions occurred in daylight as well as after dark, suggesting any effect was not due only to changes in visual conditions. One limitation of previous studies is that crime data are reported in aggregate and thus previous analyses were required to make simplifications concerning types of crimes or locations. We will overcome that by working with a UK police force to access records of individual crimes. We will use these data to determine whether the risk of crime at a specific time of day is greater after dark than during daylight. If no difference is found, this would suggest improvements to visual conditions after dark through lighting would have no effect. If however the risk of crime occurring after dark was greater than during daylight, quantifying this effect would provide a measure to assess the potential effectiveness of lighting in reducing crime risk after dark. We will use a case and control approach to analyse ten years of crime data. We will compare counts of crimes in ‘case’ hours, that are in daylight and darkness at different times of the year, and ‘control’ hours, that are in daylight throughout the year. From these counts we will calculate odds ratios as a measure of the effect of darkness on risk of crime, using these to answer three questions: 1) Is the risk of overall crime occurring greater after dark than during daylight? 2) Does the risk of crime occurring after dark vary depending on the category of crime? 3) Does the risk of crime occurring after dark vary depending on the geographical area?","2024-01-19","2024-04-06 02:29:40","2024-04-06T02:29:40Z","2024-04-05 14:46:09","e0291971","","1","19","","PLOS ONE","Does darkness increase the risk of certain types of crime?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Uttley-2024","","","","","Crime; Daylight; Medical risk factors; Police; Roads; Theft; Twilight; Violent crime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past two decades, interest in the influence of tDCS on behaviour has increased markedly, resulting in a large body of literature spanning multiple domains. However, the effect of tDCS on human performance often varies, bringing into question the reliability of this approach. While reviews and meta-analyses highlight the contributions of methodological inconsistencies and individual differences, no published studies have directly tested the intra-individual reliability of tDCS effects on behaviour. Here, we conducted a large scale, double-blinded, sham-controlled registered report to assess the reliability of two single-session low-dose tDCS montages, previously found to impact response selection and motor learning operations, across two separate time periods. Our planned analysis found no evidence for either protocol being effective nor reliable. Post-hoc explorative analyses found evidence that tDCS influenced motor learning, but not response selection learning. In addition, the reliability of motor learning performance across trials was shown to be disrupted by tDCS. These findings are amongst the first to shed light specifically on the intra-individual reliability of tDCS effects on behaviour and provide valuable information to the field.","2024-04-01","2024-04-06 02:29:36","2024-04-06T02:29:36Z","2024-04-05 16:13:17","61-79","","","173","","Cortex","Exploring the intra-individual reliability of tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: Willmot-2024","","","","","Behaviour; Intra-individual; Motor-learning; Reliability; Response-learning; tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we postulate that person-first language reduces the stigmatization of outgroups to a lesser degree if individuals hold more important negative attitudes towards the respective communities. We will test this hypothesis in a two-factorial 2 (target group) x 2 (descriptor) online experiment that includes a control group and for which we will recruit a general-population sample (N = 681). Stereotyping, dehumanization, as well as negative affect and behavioral intentions towards two outgroups will be compared: people with a physical disability/the physically disabled (i.e., negative attitudes are expected to be less important) and people who have committed a violent crime/violent criminals (i.e., negative attitudes are expected to be more important).

As there is reciprocal communication between circulating epinephrine and the LC, plasma epinephrine is used as the index of LC-NE activity. The aim of this crossover randomized controlled trial is to expand on previous findings by investigating the effects of free-weight, multiple-joint, and structural barbell resistance exercises. Previous studies have had some methodological limitations, such as failure to report the process of randomization, absence of resistance exercise familiarization before the maximal strength testing, and lack of protocol publication. To address these issues, this study incorporates resistance exercise familiarization, transparent reporting of randomization, and submission as a registered report. The results suggest that a single session of resistance exercise (barbell squat, press, and deadlift) with an intensity of 65%-78% 1RM for five repetitions (70%-90% relative intensity) and three sets with 3-min rest intervals improved Stroop congruent reaction time (RT) only (t(27) = -2.663, mean reduction = -15 ms, p = .013, 95% CI [-26, -3]). No significant enhancements were observed in Stroop incongruent RT, inhibitory control as indexed by Stroop effect, or inhibitory control as indexed by the RT difference between the Stroop task and the simple reaction task. Moreover, the alterations in plasma epinephrine levels did not significantly associate with changes in any measure of cognitive performance.","2023-12-14","2024-01-13 08:00:03","2024-01-13T08:00:03Z","","e14489","","","","","Psychophysiology","Effects of resistance exercises on inhibitory control and plasma epinephrine levels","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38095293 Citation Key: Lin-2023","","","","","Stroop task; adrenaline; autonomic; executive function; hormonal; research methods; resistance training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, multiple studies have shown a dependence on a stimulus’ angular position relative to the fovea. In humans, the resulting spatial profile of perceptual performance (the “performance field”) typically shows better performance near the lower vertical meridian, compared to the upper vertical meridian, and better performance near the horizontal meridian compared to the vertical meridian. Predominantly, these variations have been interpreted as sensory inhomogeneities. But it has also been shown that they are modulated by the allocation of spatial attention, either homogeneously elevating performance or compensating for the sensory inhomogeneities. Here, we propose a study protocol for pre-registration to investigate such interactions between sensory and attentional effects. First, we will determine performance fields for time-dependent, dynamic stimuli, namely the direction discrimination of moving random dot patterns. Then, we will establish whether directing focal attention to a particular stimulus location differentially improves thresholds compared to a distributed attention condition.","2023-11-30","2024-01-13 07:59:56","2024-01-13T07:59:56Z","2024-01-12 15:13:34","e0289411","","11","18","","PLOS ONE","Effect of attention on human direction-discrimination thresholds at iso-eccentric locations in the visual field","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Saxena-2023","","","","","Attention; Fovea centralis; Human performance; Luminance; Psychophysics; Sensory cues; Sensory perception; Vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A registered report on appearance-versus health-based message framing in exercise appeals targeted towards women","Psychology of Sport and Exercise","","1469-0292","10.1016/j.psychsport.2023.102555","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029223001796","Objective Prospect theory proposes that message framing differentially impacts the likelihood of engaging in health-related behaviors. Specifically, gain-framed messages that highlight the benefits of engaging in a behavior are more effective at promoting preventative behaviors than loss-framed messages highlighting the costs associated with a lack of engagement. Research suggests that gain-framed messages may more successfully reduce psychological reactance compared to loss-framed messages, which in turn, may promote behavioral change. However, reactance as a mechanism has been largely overlooked in the literature and support for this hypothesis is mixed. These conflicting results may be due to additional factors, such as outcomes of the targeted behavior (health vs. appearance) and goal orientation. Therefore, the present study examined whether message framing (gain-vs. loss-framing) and the fit between a health message’s outcomes of focus (i.e., health vs. appearance) and an individual’s goal orientation predict psychological reactance, and in turn, cognitive and behavioral outcomes related to exercise. Design This study employed a randomized trial with four experimental groups composed of insufficiently active women. Specifically, participants were randomized to view a loss- or gain-framed video emphasizing either health- or appearance-related outcomes. Results Counter to expectations, there were no between-group differences on exercise-related attitudes and intentions immediately post-intervention, or self-reported behavior at one-week post intervention. However, when health outcomes were emphasized, loss-framed messages generally elicited more reactivity than gain-framed messages. This finding was not replicated for the appearance conditions. Appearance messages also generally elicited more reactance than health messages. Meanwhile, reactance did not predict changes in exercise-related attitudes, intentions, or self-reported behavior, and the relationship between messaging content and reactance was generally not moderated by goal orientation. Conclusion For young inactive women, receiving messages geared towards appearance-related risks of inactivity (e.g., weight gain) tended to produce more reactivity than messages geared towards health-related risks of inactivity (e.g., weakened immune system). However, this did not change exercise-related attitudes, intentions, or self-reported behaviors. Health gain-framed education regarding exercise may be an important part of a comprehensive intervention toolkit, but is likely not enough in and of itself to support or hinder exercise engagement, regardless of framing or emphasized outcomes.","2023-10-29","2023-11-11 02:46:28","2023-11-11T02:46:28Z","2023-11-10 15:50:02","102555","","","","","Psychology of Sport and Exercise","Does messaging matter?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: More-2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A crucial point is how stimulation parameters may affect TEPs, as they may contribute to the general variability of findings across studies. Here, we manipulated two TMS parameters (i.e. current direction and pulse waveform) while measuring (a) an early TEP component reflecting contralateral inhibition of motor areas, namely, M1-P15, as an operative model of interhemispheric cortico-cortical connectivity, and (b) motor-evoked potentials (MEP) for the corticospinal pathway. Our results showed that these two TMS parameters are crucial to evoke the M1-P15, influencing its amplitude, latency, and replicability. Specifically, (a) M1-P15 amplitude was strongly affected by current direction in monophasic stimulation; (b) M1-P15 latency was significantly modulated by current direction for monophasic and biphasic pulses. The replicability of M1-P15 was substantial for the same stimulation condition. At the same time, it was poor when stimulation parameters were changed, suggesting that these factors must be controlled to obtain stable single-subject measures. Finally, MEP latency was modulated by current direction, whereas non-statistically significant changes were evident for amplitude. Overall, our study highlights the importance of TMS parameters for early TEP responses recording and suggests controlling their impact in developing connectivity biomarkers from TEPs. Moreover, these results point out that the excitability of the corticospinal tract, which is commonly used as a reference to set TMS intensity, may not correspond to the excitability of cortico-cortical pathways.","1970-01-01","2023-09-09 05:20:59","2023-09-09T05:20:59Z","2023-09-08 15:07:40","","","n/a","n/a","","","Effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) current direction and pulse waveform on cortico-cortical connectivity","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ejn.16127 Citation Key: guidaliEffectsTranscranialMagnetic","","","","","TMS-EEG; TMS-evoked potentials; cortico-cortical connectivity; corticospinal connectivity; electroencephalography; motor cortex; transcranial magnetic stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these, diabetes is one of the major therapeutic concerns globally. Moreover, Iran is among the countries with the highest incidence of diabetic patients. Furthermore, library-based studies by researchers have shown that thus far no study has been carried out to evaluate the relationship between Web-based diabetic personal health records (DPHR) and self-care indicators in Iran. Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of Web-based DPHR on self-care status of diabetic patients in an intervention group as compared with a control group. Methods: The effect of DPHR on self-care was assessed by using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol for a 2-arm parallel group with a 1:1 allocation ratio. During a 4-month trial period, the control group benefited from the routine care; the intervention group additionally had access to the Web-based DPHR app besides routine care. During the trial, 2 time points at baseline and postintervention were used to evaluate the impact of the DPHR app. A sample size of 72 people was randomly and equally assigned to both the control and intervention groups. The primary outcome measure was the self-care status of the participants. Results: Test results showed that the self-care status in the intervention group in comparison with the control group had a significant difference. In addition, the dimensions of self-care, including normal values, changes trend, the last measured value, and the last time measured values had a significant difference while other dimensions had no significant difference. Furthermore, we found no correlation between Web-based DPHR system and covariates, including scores of weight, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum creatinine, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, and planned visit adherence, as well as the change trend of mean for blood glucose and blood pressure. Conclusions: We found that as a result of the Web-based DPHR app, the self-care scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. In total, we found no correlation between the Web-based DPHR app and covariates, including planned visit adherence, HbA1c, serum creatinine, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, weight, and the change trend of mean for blood glucose and blood pressure.

Research suggests that communicating information about changing ‘dynamic’ norms may be a useful tool for changing attitudes and behaviours in the direction of those currently held by the minority. This study utilizes a 2 x 2 mixed design (Norm Type [dynamic/static] x Visual Cue [present/absent], and a no-task control), and a follow-up assessment after one week to investigate the effect of making dynamic norms salient on various meat consumption outcomes: attitudes towards meat consumption, interest in reducing one’s own meat consumption, intentions to reduce one’s own meat consumption, and self-reported meat consumption. We used an online sample of British participants (N = 1294), ranging in ages 18–77 (Mage = 39.97, SDage = 13.71; 55.8% female). We hypothesized that: (a) dynamic norms will positively influence meat consumption outcomes, (b) visual cues will accentuate the difference between norm conditions, (c) using a visual cue will enhance the effect of dynamic norms, and (d) any effects of dynamic norms will endure over a period of one week. We found no positive effect of dynamic norms (vs. static norms) on any outcome at time 1, and no positive effect on changes in outcomes from time 1 to time 2. However, we found a positive interaction of norm type and visual cue at time 1 (although not from time 1 to time 2): the addition of a visual cue to dynamic norm messages enhanced the positive effect of the message at time 1 (but did not enhance the changes occurring from time 1 to time 2).

In this context, social learning can be an advantageous survival strategy. We investigate whether people remember and communicate information attributed to someone prestigious more often than that attributed to family members, politicians, and people with experience in public health. The experimental phase will include a recall stage and an information transmission stage, which will be based on a fictitious text containing an opinion about a drug treatment for COVID-19. There will be four versions of the text, and each participant will be assigned one of these versions for the investigation. The participants will be instructed to read the fictional story and then complete a distraction exercise. Subsequently, a recall test will be performed, where they will be asked to recount the story as accurately as possible. The second stage of the experiment is aimed at testing the transmission of information where we will conduct a linear chain transmission experiment, where eight chains of four participants will be used for each story.

At the end of the experiment, there will be a self-reporting questionnaire for the participants; this allows for triangulation of the data.","2023-02-23","2023-02-27 20:40:57","2023-02-27T20:40:57Z","2023-02-27 20:40:57","e0281991","","2","18","","PLOS ONE","Does prestige bias influence the recall and transmission of COVID-19-related information?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","COVID 19; Evolutionary theory; Human learning; Memory recall; Pandemics; Personality; Public and occupational health; Virus testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of automated driving systems (ADSs) in the real world requires rigorous testing to ensure safety. To increase trust, ADSs should be tested on a large set of diverse road scenarios. Literature suggests that if a vehicle is driven along a set of geometrically diverse roads-measured using various diversity measures (DMs)-it will react in a wide range of behaviours, thereby increasing the chances of observing failures (if any), or strengthening the confidence in its safety, if no failures are observed. To the best of our knowledge, however, this assumption has never been tested before, nor have road DMs been assessed for their properties. Objective/Aim. Our goal is to perform an exploratory study on 47 currently used and new, potentially promising road DMs. Specifically, our research questions look into the road DMs themselves, to analyse their properties (e.g. monotonicity, computation efficiency), and to test correlation between DMs. Furthermore, we look at the use of road DMs to investigate whether the assumption that diverse test suites of roads expose diverse driving behaviour holds. Method. Our empirical analysis relies on a state-of-the-art, open-source ADSs testing infrastructure and uses a data set containing over 97,000 individual road geometries and matching simulation data that were collected using two driving agents. By sampling random test suites of various sizes and measuring their roads' geometric diversity, we study road DMs properties, the correlation between road DMs, and the correlation between road DMs and the observed behaviour.","2022-09-13","2023-02-24 19:13:19","2023-02-24T19:13:19Z","2023-02-24 19:13:19","","","","","","","Does Road Diversity Really Matter in Testing Automated Driving Systems?","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2209.05947 [cs]","","","","","Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2209.05947","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This registered report assessed design characteristics of registered clinical trials for COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 trials to empirically explore the design of clinical research during a pandemic and how it compares to research conducted in non-pandemic times. We did a retrospective cohort study with a 1 : 1 ratio of interventional COVID-19 registrations to non-COVID-19 registrations, with four trial design outcomes: use of control arm, randomization, blinding and prospective registration. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of investigating COVID-19 versus not COVID-19 and estimate direct and total effects of investigating COVID-19 for each outcome. The primary analysis showed a positive direct and total effect of COVID-19 on the use of control arms and randomization. It showed a negative direct effect of COVID-19 on blinding but no evidence of a total effect. There was no evidence of an effect on prospective registration. Taken together with secondary and sensitivity analyses, our findings are inconclusive but point towards a higher prevalence of key design characteristics in COVID-19 trials versus controls. The findings do not support much existing COVID-19 research quality literature, which generally suggests that COVID-19 led to a reduction in quality. Limitations included some data quality issues, minor deviations from the pre-registered plan and the fact that trial registrations were analysed which may not accurately reflect study design and conduct.

However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric tests to measure divergent thinking—an important component of creativity—in a way that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We administered two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We then subjected the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to examine which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. Results show that none of the pre-registered models fit the data well, an ambiguous result that leaves unanswered the question of whether intelligence and divergent thinking tests measure the same construct. Exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) measurement models of each test separately shows that the TTCT-F may not measure a coherent, unitary construct—leading to model misspecification when TTCT-F subtests were included in larger models.

Scoring rules have been developed to provide ex ante incentives for careful and truthful assessments and ex post evaluation measures in the context of probability assessment. We show that these scoring rules designed for probability assessment provide inappropriate incentives if used for quantile assessment. We investigate the properties of a linear family of scoring rules that are intended specifically for quantile assessment (including the assessment of multiple quantiles) and can be related to a realistic decision-making problem. These rules provide proper incentives for quantile assessment and yield higher expected scores for distributions that are more informative in the sense of having less dispersion. We discuss the special case of interval forecasts and a generalization involving transformations, and we briefly mention other possible extensions.","2009","2022-06-06 23:53:21","2022-06-06T23:53:21Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effortful thinking has been shown to help reduce anchoring effects, in which people form social judgments by adjusting from an initial value (the anchor). We therefore predicted that ego depletion would reduce the amount of adjustment from an initial anchor, leaving the final judgment relatively close to the anchor value. In contrast to previous research by Banker et al. (2017), we excluded alternative explanations, such as social mechanisms. In particular, we tested adjustment from internally generated and externally provided anchors. We theorized that judgment adjustment processes are the same for both internal and external cues. The results showed that neither self-generated nor experimenter-provided anchors were affected by ego depletion, thus leaving social mechanisms as the prime alternative explanation. The data also showed that susceptibility to anchoring is not a trait because reactions to different anchors were not substantially intercorrelated. Further, providing externally or internally generated anchors did not make a fundamental difference. However, the loss of data was higher with self-generated anchors. Overall, the results suggest that researchers can confidently rely on experimenter-generated anchors.","2020-03-01","2020-06-02 11:49:20","2020-06-02T11:49:20Z","2020-05-06 13:18:10","103942","","","87","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  Stage 1: https://osf.io/97gaf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large body of research has implicated left parietal regions in symbolic number processing. One possible explanation for this lateralization of neural activity is the handedness of participants. Specifically, participants in neuroimaging research are almost exclusively right-handed. The current study sought to probe whether number representation in the brain is associated with hand preference for handwriting. To address this question, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation of a group of right-handed participants with a group of left-handed participants during the passive viewing of symbolic numbers. At the whole-brain level, the right-handers demonstrated a previously obtained left-lateralized effect within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The left-handers showed some evidence of reverse lateralization of this effect in the IPS. However, when the groups were statistically compared, we found no regions that demonstrated group-level differences. In a follow-up region of interest (ROI) analysis within the left and right parietal lobes, we calculated laterality indices for each participant. Results did not provide support for group differences in laterality within the right or left IPS ROI. These findings do not support the hypothesis that handwriting plays a role in the lateralization of symbolic number processing in the brain. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that lead to left-lateralization for symbolic number processing.","2019-12-01","2019-12-10 08:35:23","2019-12-10T08:35:23Z","2019-12-06 14:46:04","27-43","","","121","","Cortex","Does writing handedness affect neural representation of symbolic number?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000","","","","","Handedness; Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); Number representation; Number symbols; fMRI adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many countries, it is common to see spontaneous roadside memorials constructed in response to road fatalities. These memorials are controversial and are explicitly banned in many jurisdictions. Advocates argue that the presence of memorials improves safety by making other drivers aware of an especially dangerous road where others have died, whereas opponents argue that they are distracting and decrease safety by diverting drivers’ attention away from the road. However, there has been almost no research examining the effects of roadside memorials on road user behavior and safety. In this study, 40 drivers viewed videos of road scenes with and without memorials, to examine how the presence of roadside memorials influences drivers’ attentional allocation (indicated by eye movements to the roadside area) and safety-related behaviors (indicated by perceived risk ratings and preferred travel speeds for the road). The findings indicate memorials do capture visual attention, as participants were more likely to fixate on memorials compared with a comparison object placed on the roadside. However, fixations on the memorials, and to the roadside area in general, were relatively brief. The presence of memorials did not affect perceived risk and did not produce a clear systematic effect on preferred travel speed. Nearly all drivers in our study supported permitting roadside memorials, but a small number strongly opposed memorials on the belief they are distracting and/or distressing.Preregistration detailsThis study was preregistered with Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications and received in-principle acceptance on 4 March 2018.
