However, results on large benchmarks such as FuzzBench indicate that the state-of-the-art fuzzers often reach a plateau after a certain period, typically around 12 hours. With the aid of the newly introduced FuzzIntrospector platform, this study aims to analyze and categorize the fuzz blockers that impede the progress of fuzzers. Such insights can shed light on future fuzzing research, suggesting areas that require further attention. Our preliminary findings reveal that the majority of top fuzz blockers are not directly related to the program input, emphasizing the need for enhanced techniques in automated fuzz driver generation and modification.","2023-07-17","2023-08-18 21:45:50","2023-08-18T21:45:50Z","2023-08-18 00:00:00","47–55","","","","","","Beyond the Coverage Plateau","FUZZING 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Citation Key: gaoCoveragePlateauComprehensive2023","","","","","fuzzing; software security; vulnerability detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given a set of initial seeds, greybox fuzzing continuously generates new test inputs to execute the program under test and gravitates executions towards rarely explored program regions with code coverage as feedback. Seed prioritization is an important step of greybox fuzzing that prioritizes promising seeds for input generation. However, mainstream greybox fuzzers like AFL++ and Zest tend to slight the importance of seed prioritization and plainly pick seeds according to the order of the seeds being queued, or rely on an approach with randomness, which may consequently degrade their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based seed prioritization approach named DiPri to facilitate greybox fuzzing. Specifically, DiPri calculates the distances among seeds and selects the ones that are farther from the others in priority to improve the probabilities of discovering previously unexplored regions. To make a preliminary evaluation, we integrate DiPri into AFL++ and Zest and conduct experiments on eight (four in C/C++ and four in Java) fuzz targets. We also consider six configurations, i.e., three prioritization modes multiplied by two distance measures, in our evaluation to investigate how different prioritization timings and measures affect DiPri. The experimental results show that, compared to the default seed prioritization approaches of AFL++ and Zest, DiPri covers 1.87%∼13.86% more edges in three out of four C/C++ fuzz targets and 0.29%∼4.97% more edges in the four Java fuzz targets with certain configurations. The results highlight the potential of facilitating greybox fuzzing with distance-based seed prioritization.","2023-07-17","2023-08-18 21:45:47","2023-08-18T21:45:47Z","2023-08-18 00:00:00","21–30","","","","","","DiPri","FUZZING 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Citation Key: qianDiPriDistanceBasedSeed2023","","","","","Greybox Fuzzing; Seed Distance; Seed Prioritization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, programs implemented in rust can contain critical bugs. Apart from logic bugs and crashes, code in unsafe blocks can still trigger memory corruptions. To find these, the community uses traditional fuzzers like libfuzzer or aflpp, in combination with rust-specific macros. Of course, the fuzzers themselves are still written in memory-unsafe languages. In this paper, we explore the possibility of replacing the input generators with rust, while staying compatible to existing harnesses. Based on the rust fuzzer library libafl, we develop ourtool, a drop-in replacement for the C++ component of cargo-fuzz. We evaluate our tool, written in rust, against the original fuzzer libfuzzer. We show that we are not only able to successfully fuzz all three targets we tested with ourtool, but outperform cargo-fuzz in bug coverage.

While studies have shown cross-cultural differences in levels of autism-related stigma, it remains unclear whether camouflaging and mental health difficulties vary across cultures. Hence, the current study had two aims: firstly, to determine whether significant relationships between autism acceptance, camouflaging, and mental health difficulties replicate in a more diverse cross-cultural sample of autistic adults and, secondly, to compare these variables across cultures. To fulfil these aims, 306 autistic adults from eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States) completed an online survey. Our results revealed that external acceptance and personal acceptance predicted lower levels of depression but not camouflaging or stress. Higher camouflaging predicted elevated levels of anxiety. Significant differences were found across countries in external acceptance, personal acceptance, depression, anxiety, and stress, even after controlling for relevant covariates. Specifically, autistic individuals in Japan experienced lower levels of external and personal acceptance, and those in Belgium experienced lower levels of external acceptance, than at least one other country. Unique profiles of mental health difficulties were identified across countries. Nevertheless, autistic individuals in South Africa consistently experienced the highest mental health burden, displaying elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, while those in the US experienced the lowest. Levels of camouflaging also differed across cultures, with those in Japan scoring lowest, however this became non-significant after controlling for covariates. These findings have significant implications for identifying priority regions for anti-stigma interventions and highlighting countries where greater support for mental health difficulties is needed.","2023","2023-07-28 14:54:20","2023-07-28T14:54:20Z","2023-07-28 14:54:20","","","","","","","Cross-cultural variation in experiences of acceptance, camouflaging and mental health difficulties in autism","","","","","","","","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/gmdxu Type: article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has identified cross-modal associations between musical features such as pitch, tempo, and visual features including height, and colour saturation/brightness. But while researchers have explored cross-cultural links between music and emotion as well as music and visual imagery, few studies have simultaneously investigated cross-cultural links between music, visual imagery, and emotion in order to distinguish the role of cultural experiences in contrast to innate perceptual capabilities. We hypothesize that cross-cultural emotion and cross-modal associations encompass both universality and diversity determined by innate perceptual capabilities and cultural experiences respectively and represented by: 1) cross-culturally consistent correlations between high level auditory features and low level visual features and dimensional emotions, 2) cross-cultural diversity in categorical emotional appraisal. In this study, we investigate the relationship between emotion and visual imagery induced by 6 musical excerpts in participants in Japan, Iran, and Canada through forced choice options such as matching excerpts with visual textures that vary in density, as well as dimensional and categorical emotion ratings for each excerpt manipulated in pitch and tempo. In our full manuscript, we will provide our power analysis and provide the details of our planned sample size.We will test the following four hypotheses: 1) tempo correlates with arousal levels cross-culturally, 2) tempo correlates with visual density cross-culturally, 3) emotion category ratings tend to vary between cultures and often even within cultures in response to slow tempo musical excerpts, and 4) emotion ratings show more consistency cross-culturally in response to faster tempo pieces.Each of the hypotheses helps us conclude which cross-modal and emotion associations are 1) cross-culturally consistent, or 2) culturally-dependent. If we find cross-cultural consistency across all three groups, it would suggest physiological link/embodied cognition represented in cross-modal associations. If we find consistency in two cultures only or none at all, it would suggest that cross-modal associations are culturally dependent. We also plan to conduct exploratory analyses of data on colour associations using the Berkeley Colour project stimuli.","2023","2023-03-10 14:49:23","2023-03-10T14:49:23Z","2023-03-10 14:49:21","","","","","","","Cross-modal relationships between music, emotion, and visual imagery","","","","","","","","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/qky8s Type: article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A registered report","Experimental Psychology","","2190-5142","10.1027/1618-3169/a000549","","Beliefs about how memory works explain several effects on prospective metamemory judgments (e.g., the effect of font size on judgments of learning; JOLs). Less is known about the effect of beliefs on retrospective judgments (i.e., confidence). Here, we tested whether font size also affects confidence ratings and whether beliefs play a similar role in confidence than in JOLs. In two experiments, participants studied words in small and large size, rated JOLs, and completed a font-size test in which they indicated the font size at study and a standard old/new recognition test. The results confirmed that font size affected both JOLs and confidence ratings. The presentation of the counter-belief that memory is better for words in small font size in Experiment 2 and the analyses of confidence for participants who did not believe that large fonts improved memory suggested that the effect of font size on confidence was based on beliefs. This research shows that the debate on theory-based and experience-based factors should not be limited to prospective metamemory judgments but also encompass retrospective judgments.

We show that forgetting involves losses in memory accessibility with no changes in memory precision. When participants learned a set of related word–location associations that conformed to a general pattern, we saw a strong trade-off; accessibility was enhanced, whereas precision was reduced.

However, research investigating this topic has studied a limited set of sacrificial dilemmas and did not test to what extent these effects might be moderated by specific features of the situation described in the sacrificial dilemma (for instance, whether the dilemma involves mortal or non-mortal harm). In the current manuscript, we assessed the robustness of previous findings by exploring how trust inference of utilitarian and deontological decision makers is moderated by five different contextual factors (such as whether the sacrificial harm is accomplished by an action or inaction), as well as by participants’ own moral preferences.

Here, the automaticity of this gaze-following behaviour phenomenon was further tested by exploring whether such an effect can be detected in response to briefly-presented masked averted gazes. Participants completed an oculomotor interference task consisting of making leftward/rightward saccades according to a symbolic instruction cue. Crucially, either a task-irrelevant averted-gaze face or an arrow (i.e., a non-social control stimulus) was also presented in different blocks of trials. Faces and arrows were presented for either 1000 ms, or 8 ms and then backward-masked, to reduce the likelihood of conscious processing.

If so, do people seek out different experiences in pursuing meaning versus happiness? In an adversarial collaboration, we conducted three preregistered experiments (total N = 879) to address these questions. We asked participants to describe an experience from the past month (Study 1) or past day (Study 2) that had provided them with either happiness, meaning, happiness without meaning, or meaning without happiness. Experiences that were happy but not meaningful differed substantially from those that were meaningful but not happy. However, experiences that provided happiness showed only small differences from those that provided meaning. In Study 3, to examine whether people seek out different experiences in pursuing happiness versus meaning, we instructed participants to choose an activity over the weekend that would provide them with happiness, meaning, happiness without meaning, or meaning without happiness. Again, experiences differed substantially when people pursued happiness without meaning or meaning without happiness, but these differences disappeared when people were simply told to pursue happiness or meaning. Our findings suggest that happiness and meaning are linked to distinct sets of thoughts, feelings and behaviors, but the differences between them are small in everyday life.","2017-10-02","2021-01-06 14:39:19","2021-01-06T14:39:19Z","2017-10-23 18:52:27","1-17","","0","0","","","Cousins or conjoined twins","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","00000","","","","","eudaimonia; happiness; hedonia; meaning; subjective well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The consequences are debilitating and place a great burden on patients, caregivers, and the health care system. Although inpatient rehabilitation programs have proven effective, the best practices for community-based rehabilitation required to maintain the gains in function and mobility post hospital discharge are currently unknown. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation post hospital discharge interventions for older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) following a hip fracture, and to identify the physical recovery outcomes and measures used in previous studies. Methods: The methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention were followed and findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search strategy included a combination of text words and subject headings relating to the concepts of CI, dementia, delirium, cognitive reserve, and hip fractures. For a study to be included in the review, it had to involve participants with CI who underwent hip fracture surgery, and consisted of an outpatient intervention that occurred in the participant&#8217;s home or community. Peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching various databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts to determine which articles comprising of a rehabilitation intervention within a community setting prior to being included for a full article review. A data extraction form and an evidence and quality checklist were used during the full article data analysis and synthesis. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity of measures and outcomes. Results: The original search resulted in over 3000 articles. Of those, three studies satisfied the necessary criteria to be included in the systematic review. All studies included inpatient and outpatient physiotherapy, with some including a cognitive component, family education, and a discharge assessment. Conclusions: The findings from this review suggest that community-based rehabilitation post hospital discharge interventions show promising results towards improving various physical function outcomes, mobility, and activities of daily living for older adults with CI following a hip fracture. This review also demonstrates and discusses the current lack of outpatient rehabilitation interventions targeted towards older adults with CI post-hip fracture. Additionally, several substantive gaps that require attention to move this field forward are highlighted.

In contradiction to this general finding, Kurzban et al. (2001) showed that race encoding is not automatic and inevitable, but rather a byproduct of categorization in terms of coalitions. In particular, they argue and empirically support that when other coalitional information is present, the encoding of race is spectacularly reduced. In the present contribution, we present a replication of the race-erased effect reported by Kurzban et al. First, we give a detailed overview of the hypotheses, the experimental methodology, the derivation of the sample size required to achieve a power of 95%, and the criteria that need to be met for a successful replication. Then we present the findings of an empirical test that met the requirements of our power analyses. Our results indicate that the encoding of race is indeed reduced when another coalitional cue is available, yet this reduction is less marked than in the original study.

Two accounts have been proposed to explain this relationship, one of which emphasizes proximally avoiding outgroups, and the other of which emphasizes adherence to traditional norms. According to the former, immigrants are perceived as being more infectious because they carry novel pathogens due to their foreign ecological origins. According to the latter, immigrants' foreign norms are perceived as posing a pathogen threat. This study aimed to disentangle these accounts. Participants (N = 975) were randomly assigned to read a description of an immigrant who had high or low contact with locals and high or low assimilation to local norms. The effect of disgust sensitivity on sentiments toward the immigrant (and immigrants like him) was compared across conditions. Results supported the traditional norms account: disgust sensitivity related to anti-immigrant sentiments when the immigrant was described as not assimilating to local norms, but not when he was described as assimilating. Contrary to the outgroup avoidance account, the relationship between disgust sensitivity and anti-immigrant sentiments did not vary across the high-contact and low-contact conditions. Results suggest that resistance to foreign norms, rather than avoidance of novel pathogens, better explains the relationship between pathogen avoidance and outgroup prejudice.","2019-09-01","2019-10-31 20:40:56","2019-10-31T20:40:56Z","2019-10-02 14:49:58","103817","","","84","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00002","","","","","Disgust sensitivity; Immigration; Outgroup avoidance; The behavioral immune system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A registered report","Judgment and Decision Making","","","","http://journal.sjdm.org/18/18510/jdm18510.pdf","Executing an important decision can be as easy as moving a mouse cursor or reaching towards the preferred option with a hand. But would we decide differently if choosing required walking a few steps towards an option? More generally, is our preference invariant to the means and motor costs of reporting it? Previous research demonstrated that asymmetric motor costs can nudge the decision-maker towards a less costly option. However, virtually all traditional decision-making theories predict that increasing motor costs symmetrically for all options should not affect choice in any way. This prediction is disputed by the theory of embodied cognition, which suggests that motor behavior is an integral part of cognitive processes, and that motor costs can affect our choices. In this registered report, we investigated whether varying motor costs can affect response dynamics and the final choices in an intertemporal choice task: choosing between a readily available small reward and a larger but delayed reward. Our study compared choices reported by moving a computer mouse cursor towards the preferred option with the choices executed via a more motor costly walking procedure. First, we investigated whether relative values of the intertemporal choice options affect walking trajectories in the same way as they affect mouse cursor dynamics. Second, we tested a hypothesis that, in the walking condition, increased motor costs of a preference reversal would decrease the number of changes-of-mind and therefore increase the proportion of impulsive, smaller-but-sooner choices. We confirmed the hypothesis that walking trajectories reflect covert dynamics of decision making, and rejected the hypothesis that increased motor costs of responding affect decisions in an intertemporal choice task. Overall, this study contributes to the empirical basis enabling the decision-making theories to address the complex interplay between cognitive and motor processes.","2019-07","2019-10-31 20:40:18","2019-10-31T20:40:18Z","","455-469","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00000","","","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
