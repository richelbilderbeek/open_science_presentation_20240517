# Introduction

## Statement

'Although publishing the analysis of research before having seen the data
so prevents Questionable Research Practices,
for an exploratory study, one cannot do a useful analysis beforehand'

## Research question

On publishing the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data:

- why?
- has it been done?

## Registered report @chambers2019s

![](chambers_nature_registered_reports.jpg)

## Place of preregistration @osfSubmitRegistered

![](prereg_and_rr.png)

# Setup

-   Literature search
-   Empirical work

# Setup of literature search

-   Search the literature for 'preregistration+exploratory' on [https://scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com)
-   Of top 10, select for papers that seem able to answer the research question 'Can one publish the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data?'
-   Read those, write down the answer to the question, if any

## General literature search results

-   29,400 results

## Answers 1/4: why preregister for exploratory studies? 

Exploratory research:

- make exploratory research more trustworthy @dirnagl2020preregistration @toth2021study @wojan2023registered
- make exploratory research more useful @dirnagl2020preregistration
- improves the innovative scientiﬁc process of discovery @jonas2016can

## Answers 2/4: why preregister for exploratory studies? 

Analysis 1/2:

- distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analyses @toth2021study @mcphetres2020should
- increase study quality due to Stage 1 review @dirnagl2020preregistration
- save resources, due to Stage 1 review @dirnagl2020preregistration

## Answers 3/4: why preregister for exploratory studies? 

Analysis 2/2:

- allows to set a stopping rule  @toth2021study
- allows to determine which tools will be used @toth2021study
- one can specify an analyses prior to data collection @p2021pre
- get credit for fully planned analyses @p2021pre

## Answers 4/4: why preregister for exploratory studies? 

Reduce QRP:

- reduces file drawering @mcphetres2020should
- reduce p-hacking @p2021pre
- prevent HARKing @cockburn2018hark
- 'avoid imaginary post hoc storytelling' @dirnagl2020preregistration

## Answers 5/4: why preregister for exploratory studies? 

Missing according to me:

- an experiment always move forwards
- it forces supervisors to stop asking 'one more analysis'

## Effects of preregistering an exploratory study

- preregistration effectively facilitated more transparent reporting 
  based on criteria (i.e., confirmed hypotheses and a priori analysis plans) @toth2021study.
- preregistered samples had fewer statistically significant results (48%) 
  than non-preregistered samples (66%) @toth2021study

# Setup of empirical work

-   Search for registered reports that are exploratory
-   Which fields?
-   How was analysis specified?
-   Was the design changed?

## Empirical work results: get all registered reports

-   Finding registered reports is hard! Please let me know if you find something better!
-   Found a manually curated list of 351 registered reports at <https://www.zotero.org/groups/479248/osf/collections/KEJP68G9>.
-   Clumsy! Cannot export all entries at once, I stitched together all parts to [rr.csv](rr.csv) using an R script.

## Empirical work results: select exploratory studies 1/2

-   Exploring decoy effects on computerized task preferences in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) @parrish2018exploring
-   Exploring the intra-individual reliability of tDCS [*]: A registered report @willmot2024exploring

[*] tDCS: Transcranial direct current stimulation.

Reporting statistical test:

- 'We will [use] a 3x2 Chi Square test for independence for each monkey' @parrish2018exploring
- 'we will conduct a Student’s t-test for paired samples' @frenken2018exploring

## Empirical work results: how was analysis specified? 5/9

Testing assumptions of experiment:

- 'We also will compare the proportion of choices of the [tasks], 
  to determine if the presence of [the intervention] [indeed] 
  affected the relative choice preferences for [the control] tasks' @parrish2018exploring
- 'We assume at least a medium effect size of Cohen’s d > 0.5' @frenken2018exploring

## Empirical work results: how was analysis specified? 6/9

  the results of the study cannot be interpreted regarding the present research question' @frenken2018exploring

## Empirical work results: how was analysis specified? 7/9

Report exclusion rule:

- 'individuals who score 2.5 SDs above or below the mean for response time or accuracy,

Doing partial replication:

- 'as a partial replication of previous research, we will [replication procedure]' @parrish2018exploring
- 'Bayesian paired-sample t-tests will run on sham and [real setup]. A small-to-medium effect (d ≤ 0.2) of tDCS, consistent with previous studies [references], is expected' @willmot2024exploring
- 'Based on previous [studies][references], we predict that [...] effects in both tasks should reach at least moderately reliable thresholds (p > .60, r > .30) within individuals' @willmot2024exploring

## Empirical work results: how was analysis specified? 9/9

Drawing conclusions:

- 'If we observe a null result, the [...] paradigm failed to work or [alternative explanation] and hypothesis 3 will be obsolete' @frenken2018exploring
- 'A null result [of an analysis] indicates that either [a paradigm] does not exist or that the experimental paradigm does not work in the expected way' @frenken2018exploring

## Empirical work results: Was the design changed?

2 out of 3 changed the study design:

Added one experiment, from @parrish2018exploring:

> This experiment was added after acceptance of the pre-registered manuscript. 
> These methods were not included in the original pre-registered review process, 
> but were reviewed by the editor for appropriateness 
> with the original submission aims and proposed methodology.

## Empirical work results: Was the design changed?

Changed experimental setup, from @frenken2018exploring:

> We had to apply the following changes to the pre-registered procedure: 
> Concerning the experimental methods, 
> the cue presentation lasts 1500 ms instead of 1000 ms due to a technical error. 
> Regarding the analysis, we deem re-referencing of EEG data 
> necessary for interpretable results 
> because the proximity of the reference electrode to the main electrode (Fz) 
> artiﬁcially diminishes the signal of interest. 
> Therefore, we re-referenced the EEG signal to the average 
> of all active scalp electrodes.

## Pregistration with logging?

From @dirnagl2020preregistration

> Through the log, reviewers could monitor the work as it unfolds, 
> a “rolling review,” as proposed by [7]. 
> Alternatively, the log could be kept as an open laboratory notebook [9]. 
> The ensuing log would lead to a real “next we” narrative, 
> not the imaginary post hoc storytelling that is presently common. 

- [7] is @chambers2020registered
- [9] is @schapira2019open

# Conclusions

## Conclusion 1/5

Problems with method today:

- unable to search specifically for registered reports
- unable to search specifically for exploratory research

## Conclusion 2/5

Why publish the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data:

  - distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analyses @toth2021study @mcphetres2020should
  - make exploratory research better @dirnagl2020preregistration @toth2021study @jonas2016can
  - allows to set a stopping rule  @toth2021study @p2021pre
  - reduce QRP @mcphetres2020should @p2021pre @cockburn2018hark @dirnagl2020preregistration

## Conclusion 3/5

Has the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data been published?

Yes!

-   4 out of 351 registered reports have the word 'exploratory' in their title @parrish2018exploring @willmot2024exploring @frenken2018exploring @wojan2023registered
-   3 of these 4 have a preregistration @parrish2018exploring @willmot2024exploring @frenken2018exploring
-   fields were behavior @parrish2018exploring, physiology @willmot2024exploring and cognition @frenken2018exploring
-   The analysis was specified in details with different styles

## Conclusion 4/5

-   2 out of 3 preregistered studies changed the study design:
    - change experimental setup @frenken2018exploring
    - added an experiment @parrish2018exploring

## Conclusion 5/5

- Lack of diversity in fields that do a registered report
- No qualitative studies found, although there are recommendations @toth2021study
- A rolling review seems great as a low-tech way to be transparent and free

# Discussion

## My statement

> Any study should be preregistered when possible

> Richèl Bilderbeek

Please try to change my mind!

## Discussion

- Used a quick-and-too-dirty approach?
    - Too few registered reports?
    - Too sloppy selection for exploratory research?
