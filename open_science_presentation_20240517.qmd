# On publishing the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data

![](CC0.png) Richèl Bilderbeek

# Introduction

## Research question

Can one publish the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data?

## Terms

Preregistration = publishing the analysis of research 
before having seen the data @chambers2019s

## Why?

Preregistration prevents Questionable Research Practices 

## Why not?

For an exploratory study, one cannot do a useful analysis beforehand.

# Setup

 * Literature search
 * Empirical work

# Setup of literature search

 * Search the literature for 'preregistration+exploratory'

# Setup of empirical work

 * Search for registered reports that are exploratory
 * Read the associated papers for an answer of 
   'Can one publish the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data?'

## Empirical work results: get all registered reports

 * Finding registered reports is hard! 
   Please let me know if you find something better!

 * Found a manually curated list of 351 registered reports at <https://www.zotero.org/groups/479248/osf/collections/KEJP68G9>.

 * Clumsy! Cannot export all entries at once, 
   I stitched together all parts to [rr.csv](rr.csv) using an R script.

## Empirical work results: select exploratory studies

## Empirical work results: answers
