However, research on masculine generic morphology in other gender-marked languages has shown that this can create an over-representation of men and a male-bias in perception. Given the extensive use of default masculine grammatical gender in the context of job recruitment, education, and formal communication where women are typically underrepresented and men overrepresented, this widely accepted notion needs to be investigated. The primary aim of this research is to understand how grammatical gender in Arabic mediates occupational expectations based on the language currently used in job recruitment in Arabic speaking countries. Specifically, the study explores how the use of default masculine grammatical gender can create a male-bias in perception. The secondary aim of this research is to test whether gender-inclusive language can reduce this male-bias in perception and instead increase the accessibility, activation, and retrieval of exemplars related to other gender minorities (i.e., reduce male-bias in perception). This is achieved through a novel prompted speech production experiment, based on an adaptation of the popular board game ’Taboo’ where participants are asked to describe role nouns presented (e.g., doctor or nurse) in different language conditions.","2023-10-20","2023-11-11 02:46:31","2023-11-11T02:46:31Z","2023-11-10 15:47:32","e0292936","","10","18","","PLOS ONE","Registered report protocol","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Soliman-2023","","","","","Experimental design; Languages; Linguistic morphology; Multilingualism; Nurses; Psychological attitudes; Sexual and gender issues; Speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"A5SCFUG6","book","2023","Feldman, Gilad","Registered Report Stage 1 manuscript template","","","","","","This Registered Report collaborative template aims to address the growing prevalence of Registered Reports. Registered Reports (http://cos.io/rr) are a new publication process now adopted by hundreds of journals across the sciences, in which journal peer review is conducted in two stages. The Stage 1 review is conducted on a pre-registration plan prior to any data collection to arrive at an agreement and an official registration of the plan, with the journal issuing an in-principle acceptance. Stage 2 review ensures that plan has been followed or that deviations have been noted and justified. Registered Report Stage 1 submissions differ from common pre-registration templates in that they look like a regular manuscript, with the following differences: 1) manuscript reflects a future plan, 2) results are written on simulated randomized data or as a data analysis plan, 3) discussion section details planned issues to discuss in Stage 2. This template is meant to structure the manuscript style pre-registration with a very detailed and comprehensive plan that would increase the potential of communicating to reviewers all needed aspects for them to be able to provide constructive helpful feedback. The template has been pre-tested extensively in over 40 submissions of the CORE team (2023) and is continuously updated and improved.

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells with the small-molecular inhibitor of BET bromodomains, (+)-JQ1, selectively downregulated MYC transcription, which is similar to what was reported in the original study (Figure 3B; Delmore et al., 2011). Efficacy of (+)-JQ1 was evaluated in an orthotopically xenografted model of MM. Overall survival was increased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control, similar to the original study (Figure 7E; Delmore et al., 2011). Tumor burden, as determined by bioluminescence, was decreased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7C-D; Delmore et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. The opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference was limited though, due to the higher rate of early death in the control group, and increased overall survival in (+)-JQ1 treated mice before the pre-specified tumor burden analysis endpoint. Additionally, we evaluated the (−)-JQ1 enantiomer that is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains, which resulted in a minimal impact on MYC transcription, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in tumor burden or survival distributions compared to treatment with (+)-JQ1.

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of immune competent mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors with anti-mouse CD47 antibodies resulted in short-term anemia compared to controls, consistent with the previously described function of CD47 in normal phagocytosis of aging red blood cells and results reported in the original study (Table S4; Willingham et al., 2012). The weight of tumors after 30 days administration of anti-CD47 antibodies or IgG isotype control were not found to be statistically different, whereas the original study reported inhibition of tumor growth with anti-CD47 treatment (Figure 6A,B; Willingham et al., 2012). However, our efforts to replicate this experiment were confounded because spontaneous regression of tumors occurred in several of the mice. Additionally, the excised tumors were scored for inflammatory cell infiltrates. We found IgG and anti-CD47 treated tumors resulted in minimal to moderate lymphocytic infiltrate, while the original study observed sparse lymphocytic infiltrate in IgG-treated tumors and increased inflammatory cell infiltrates in anti-CD47 treated tumors (Figure 6C; Willingham et al., 2012). Furthermore, we observed neutrophilic infiltration was slightly increased in anti-CD47 treated tumors compared to IgG control.

Here we report the results of those experiments. We regenerated cells stably expressing ectopic wild-type and mutant phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) using the same immortalized human NRASG12D melanocytes as the original study. Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression. The monitoring of tumor formation of these stable cells in vivo resulted in no statistically significant difference in tumor-free survival driven by PREX2 variants, whereas the original study reported that these PREX2 mutations increased the rate of tumor incidence compared to controls (Figure 3B and S6B; Berger et al., 2012). Surprisingly, the median tumor-free survival was 1 week in this replication attempt, while 70% of the control mice were reported to be tumor-free after 9 weeks in the original study. The rapid tumor onset observed in this replication attempt, compared to the original study, makes the detection of accelerated tumor growth in PREX2 expressing NRASG12D melanocytes extremely difficult.

How diversity is associated with outcomes of interest is particularly susceptible to the production of nonreplicable findings given the very large number of alternative measures applied to several policy relevant attributes such as race, ethnicity, gender, or foreign-born status. The very large number of alternative measures substantially increases the probability of false discovery where nominally significant parameter estimates—selected through numerous though unreported specification tests—may not be representative of true associations in the population. The purpose of this registered report is to: 1) select a single measure of ownership diversity that satisfies explicit, requisite axioms; 2) split the Annual Business Survey (ABS) into an exploratory sample (35%) used in this analysis and a confirmatory sample (65%) that will be accessed only after the publication of this report; 3) regress self-reported new-to-market innovation on the diversity measure along with industry and firm-size controls; 4) pass through those variables meeting precision and magnitude criteria for hypothesis testing using the confirmatory sample; and 5) document the full set of hypotheses to be tested in the final analysis along with a discussion of the false discovery and family-wise error rate corrections to be applied. The discussion concludes with the added value of implementing split sample designs within the Federal Statistical Research Data Center system where access to data is strictly controlled.","2023-03","2023-05-01 06:59:58","2023-05-01T06:59:58Z","2023-04-14 16:55:31","","","","","","","Registered Report","","","","Working Papers","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Number: 23-11 Publisher: Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau","","","","","Split-sample; false discovery; hypothesis testing; self-reported innovation; women and minority owned business; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale replication attempts for psychological results yielded shockingly low success rates and contributed to an increasing demand for open science practices among psychologists. However, preregistering one’s studies is still not the norm in the field. Here, we conducted a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy. Methods In a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an online survey assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Respondents (N = 289) were psychological researchers that were recruited through their publications on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predicted that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers’ intention to preregister (directional hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expected an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (non-directional hypothesis 2). We analyzed these hypotheses with multiple regression models and included preregistration experience as a control variable. Results Researchers’ attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and the perceived importance of preregistration significantly predicted researchers’ intention to use preregistration in the future (see hypothesis 1). Research experience influenced both researchers’ attitudes and their perception of motivations to preregister, but not the perception of obstacles (see hypothesis 2). Descriptive reports on researchers’ attitudes, motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration are provided. Discussion Many researchers had already preregistered and had a rather positive attitude toward preregistration. Nevertheless, several obstacles were identified that may be addressed to improve and foster preregistration.","2023-03-16","2023-04-11 17:19:46","2023-04-11T17:19:46Z","2023-04-11 17:19:44","e0281086","","3","18","","PLOS ONE","Registered report","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Behavior; Careers; Motivation; Open science; Pilot studies; Psychological attitudes; Psychology; Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants in the “weak-incentive to cheat” could also choose to lie but the outcome was a prosocial one (i.e., benefit for unknown co-participant). Two-days later, memory for the die-rolling event was assessed. A similar number of participants lied to avoid punishment as for prosocial reasons.

Seemingly, this resulted in few experiments using financial incentives (e.g., money, vouchers) as a strategy to motivate the participants' behavior; which is typically done in other research communities, such as economics or psychology. Even the current version of the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards does mention payouts for completing surveys only, but not for mimicking the real-world or motivating realistic behavior during experiments. So, there is a lack of understanding regarding whether financial incentives can or cannot be useful for software-engineering experimentation. To tackle this problem, we plan a survey based on which we will conduct a controlled laboratory experiment. Precisely, we will use the survey to elicit incentivization schemes we will employ as (up to) four payoff functions (i.e., mappings of choices or performance in an experiment to a monetary payment) during a code-review task in the experiment: (1) a scheme that employees prefer, (2) a scheme that is actually employed, (3) a scheme that is performance-independent, and (4) a scheme that mimics an open-source scenario. Using a between-subject design, we aim to explore how the different schemes impact the participants' performance. Our contributions help understand the impact of financial incentives on developers in experiments as well as real-world scenarios, guiding researchers in designing experiments and organizations in compensating developers.","2022-07-07","2023-02-24 21:47:44","2023-02-24T21:47:44Z","2023-02-24 21:47:44","","","","","","","Registered Report","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2202.10985 [cs]","","","","","Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2202.10985","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research explored how features of measured attributes and individual differences affect the relationship between implicit and explicit measures using existing data (Hussey, Hughes, & Nosek, 2018). In the original study, participants completed measures of explicit evaluation or identification (i.e., difference scores between self-report items) and implicit evaluation or identification (i.e., the Implicit Association Test; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) for one of 95 target pairs. First, we attempted to conceptually replicate Nosek's (2005) findings that self-presentation, distinctiveness, elaboration/importance, and complementarity moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations across individuals irrespective of attribute targets. These attribute features each moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations and accounted for unique variation in implicit-explicit relations. Second, we tested whether these features affected the relationship between implicit and explicit identifications. We found moderating effects of distinctiveness and complementarity but not of the other attribute features, likely due to their operationalization. Finally, we examined whether theoretically relevant individual difference measures moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations or identifications. Across almost all analyses, these measures (i.e., socially desirable responding, self-monitoring, need for cognition, personal need for structure, and need for cognitive closure) did not moderate implicit-explicit relations. Taken together, our results suggest that relationships between implicit and explicit measures reflect individual experiences with attribute targets rather than the cultural context, targets, or individuals themselves.","2022-05-01","2023-02-24 21:39:37","2023-02-24T21:39:37Z","2023-02-24 21:39:37","104280","","","100","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Registered report","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Implicit bias; Implicit measures; Implicit-explicit relations; Individual differences; Moderation; Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Is religious cooperation intuitively parochial against atheists? Evidence supporting the social heuristics hypothesis (SHH) suggests that cooperation is intuitive, independent of religious group identity. We tested this prediction in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game, where 1,280 practising Christian believers were paired with either a coreligionist or an atheist and where time limits were used to increase reliance on either intuitive or deliberated decisions. We explored another dual-process account of cooperation, the self-control account (SCA), which suggests that visceral reactions tend to be selfish and that cooperation requires deliberation. We found evidence for religious parochialism but no support for SHH’s prediction of intuitive cooperation. Consistent with SCA but requiring confirmation in future studies, exploratory analyses showed that religious parochialism involves decision conflict and concern for strong reciprocity and that deliberation promotes cooperation independent of religious group identity.","2021-04","2023-02-24 21:29:04","2023-02-24T21:29:04Z","2023-02-24 21:29:04","512-521","","4","5","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Economics; Human behaviour; Religion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some neuroimaging studies report cerebellar involvement whereas others do not. This discrepancy may stem from underpowered studies, differences in statistical modeling or variation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and processing. To resolve this, we investigated the cerebellar structural differences using a local advanced ET dataset augmented by matched controls from PPMI and ADNI. We tested the hypothesis of cerebellar involvement using three neuroimaging biomarkers: VBM, gray/white matter volumetry and lobular volumetry. Furthermore, we assessed the impacts of statistical models and segmentation pipelines on results. Results indicate that the detected cerebellar structural changes vary with methodology. Significant reduction of right cerebellar gray matter and increase of the left cerebellar white matter were the only two biomarkers consistently identified by multiple methods. Results also show substantial volumetric overestimation from SUIT-based segmentation—partially explaining previous literature discrepancies. This study suggests that current estimation of cerebellar involvement in ET may be overemphasized in MRI studies and highlights the importance of methods sensitivity analysis on results interpretation. ET datasets with large sample size and replication studies are required to improve our understanding of regional specificity of cerebellum involvement in ET.","2023-01-11","2023-02-24 19:13:40","2023-02-24T19:13:40Z","2023-02-24 19:13:40","581","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Movement disorders; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frailty is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Many validated instruments to detect frailty have been developed. Using these in clinical practice takes time. Automated estimation of the probability of being frail using routinely collected data from hospital electronic health records (EHRs) would circumvent that. We aim to identify potential predictors that could be used as features for modeling algorithms on the basis of routine hospital EHR data to incorporate in an automated tool for estimating the probability of being frail. Methods PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL Plus, Embase, and Web of Science will be searched. The studied population consists of older people (≥65 years). The first step is searching articles published ≥2018. Second, we add two published literature reviews (and the articles included therein) [Bery 2020; Bouillon, 2013] to our search results. In these reviews, articles on potential predictor variables in frailty screening tools were included from inception until March 2018. The goal is to identify and extract all potential predictors of being frail. Domain experts will be consulted to evaluate the results. Discussion The results of the intended study will increase the quality of the developed algorithms to be used for automated estimation of the probability of being frail in secondary care. This is a promising perspective, being less labor-intensive compared to screening each individual patient by hand. Also, such an automated tool may raise awareness of frailty, especially in those patients who would not be screened for frailty by hand because they seem robust. Conclusion The identified potential predictors of being frail can be used as evidence-based input for machine learning based automated estimation of the probability of being frail using routine EHR data in the near future.","2022-09-27","2023-02-24 19:13:00","2023-02-24T19:13:00Z","2023-02-24 19:13:00","e0275230","","9","17","","PLOS ONE","Registered report protocol","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Database searching; Electronic medical records; Frailty; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Medical risk factors; Supervised machine learning; Systematic reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased tumor volume compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. Cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using ACHN renal cell carcinoma cells did not differ from vehicle control treatment, similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 1; Sirota et al., 2011). Doxorubicin treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not result in a statistically significant difference compared to vehicle control despite tumor volume being reduced to levels similar to those reported in the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011). Finally, we report a random effects meta-analysis for each result. These meta-analyses show that the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant effect, as did the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by doxorubicin.
