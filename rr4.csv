Our secondary purpose is to investigate whether the influence of memory distrust on imagination inflation is moderated by traits that are described as disengagement from reality and to test whether memory distrust mediates the relationship between self-esteem and imagination inflation. In a three-step procedure, participants (N = 300) will assess their confidence that a list of childhood events happened to them; then, they will imagine three of these events and reassess their confidence. Half of the participants will undergo a memory distrust induction procedure. In order to sensitize participants to discrepancies, some of them will be given cues about the source and/or perspective of the imagined events.","2024-02-07","2024-04-06 02:29:35","2024-04-06T02:29:35Z","2024-04-05 16:14:37","e0297774","","2","19","","PLOS ONE","Memory distrust and imagination inflation","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Dudek-2024","","","","","False memories; Memory; Memory recall; Nonbelieved memories; Personality; Personality tests; Questionnaires; Vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed children's MSC and helping, sharing and comforting behaviours in a laboratory setting. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a three-dimensional MSC structure at 5 and 6 years, but not at 4 years. There was inconsistent stability across time points regarding prosocial behaviour and MSC. For the comforting domain, but not the other domains, cross-lagged relations between self-concept and behaviour were present. Moreover, helping behaviour and self-concept were inter-related at 6 years. Results provide support for reciprocal associations between MSC and prosocial behaviour, albeit only in the comforting domain.

Two psychological approaches to the study of SES say they are, but emphasize different reasons. The rank approach argues that because individuals with lower SES experience low rank, they feel less in control and more threatened by others, so it is more valuable for them to understand others' mental states. The cultural approach argues that because lower SES cultures foster more interdependent values, people steeped in those cultures focus more on others, leading them to better understand others' mental states. Previous tests of the basic hypothesis these two approaches share have yielded mixed evidence. This registered report uses a large-scale, nationally representative sample to accomplish two goals. First, it tests the basic shared hypothesis, finding that lower subjective rank, social class cultural group, and income—but not education—all predict better empathic accuracy. Second, it explores additional research questions, finding that subjective rank more strongly predicts empathic accuracy compared to SES cultural group (consistent with the rank approach), but childhood SES more strongly predicts empathic accuracy than adulthood SES (consistent with the cultural approach). Results regarding the moderating role of the valence of the mental state being recognized were not consistent. We conclude there is indeed a negative association between social class and empathic accuracy, and discuss the degree to which this is due to the psychology of rank and childhood cultural socialization.","2024-03-01","2024-01-13 07:59:52","2024-01-13T07:59:52Z","2024-01-12 16:01:28","104577","","","111","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Lower social class, better social skills?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: Engstrom-2024","","","","","Empathic accuracy; Registered report; Social class; Socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear whether the effect is driven by automatic entrainment to rhythm or non-rhythmic temporal prediction. This registered report presents an Electroencephalographic (EEG) study aimed at establishing the cognitive and neural mechanisms of the effect of temporal prediction on recognition. In a blocked design, stimulus onset during encoding was systematically manipulated in four conditions prior to recognition testing: rhythmic fixed (RF), rhythmic variable (RV), arrhythmic fixed (AF), and arrhythmic variable (AV). By orthogonally varying rhythm and temporal position we were able to assess their independent contributions to recognition enhancement. Our behavioural results did not replicate previous findings that show a difference in recognition memory based on temporal predictability at encoding. However, event-related potential (ERP) component analysis did show an early (N1) interaction effect of temporal position and rhythm, and later (N2 and Dm) effects driven by temporal position only. Taken together, we observed effects of temporal prediction at encoding, but these differences did not translate to later effects of memory, suggesting that effects of temporal prediction on recognition are less robust than previously thought.","2023-12-01","2023-11-10 15:38:41","2023-11-10T15:38:41Z","2023-11-10 15:37:59","130-145","","","169","","Cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: Jones-2023","","","","","EEG; Prediction; Recognition memory; Rhythm; Temporal expectation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We verified whether recognizing discrepancies between personal memories and externally suggested information, along with certain individual differences, moderates the memory distrust-suggestibility link. Methods Experiment 1 (N = 306) followed a classic three-step procedure with a discrepancy awareness test. In Experiment 2 (N = 316) a computerized version of the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale with a discrepancy awareness test was utilized. Both experiments manipulated the state of memory distrust and assessed participants' trait memory distrust, compliance, anxiety and self-esteem. Results While the effect of memory deterioration due to misinformation and suggestions was replicated, the hypotheses regarding the relationship between memory distrust and suggestibility were not confirmed. However, for interrogative suggestibility, individuals induced to doubt their own memory were more susceptible to suggestions when recognizing inconsistencies between the story and suggestive questions. Conclusions From the theoretical side, the concept of memory distrust appears to be useful to explain the reasons for succumbing to suggestions. However, our findings indicate that memory distrust toward committing omission errors and the experimentally induced state appear unrelated (misinformation effect paradigm) or marginally related (memory distrust state and interrogative suggestibility) to the tendency to yield to suggestions. This prompts further research using a different operationalisation of this construct.","","2023-11-10 15:32:03","2023-11-10T15:32:03Z","2023-11-10 15:31:21","","","n/a","n/a","","","Memory distrust and suggestibility","","","","","","","en","© 2023 British Psychological Society.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/lcrp.12249 Citation Key: Dudek-","","","","","discrepancy detection; interrogative suggestibility; memory distrust; misinformation effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Looking across 44 outcomes, the authors found that the YRBS contains responses that are potentially biased against LGBQ youth in systematic ways, inflating perceived risk for this group in some outcomes. This potential bias is more pronounced among reported males than among reported females, and it is more pronounced for low-incidence outcomes. For example, the steroid-use disparity estimate among reported males reduced by 67%, while the reduction in bullying victimization was small and not statistically significant.

Its flexibility, automated nature, and effectiveness render it an indispensable tool for making software more secure. A key feature that enables its impressive performance is coverage feedback, which guides the fuzzer to explore different parts of the program. The most prominent way to use this feedback is novelty search, in which the fuzzer generates new inputs and only keeps those that have exercised a new program edge. This is grounded in the assumption that novel coverage is a proxy for interestingness. Bolstered by its widespread success, it is easy to overlook its limitations. Particularly the phenomenon of input shadowing, situations in which an “interesting” input is discarded because it does not contribute novel coverage, needs to be considered. This phenomenon limits the explorable input space and risks missing bugs when shadowed inputs are more amenable to mutations that would trigger bugs. In this work, we analyze input shadowing in more detail and find that multiple fuzzing runs of the same target exhibit a different basic block hit frequency despite overlapping code coverage. In other words, different fuzzing runs may find the same set of basic blocks but one might exercise specific basic blocks significantly more often than the other, and vice versa. To better distribute the frequency, we propose restarting the fuzzer to reset the fuzzing state, diversifying the fuzzer’s attention across basic blocks. Our preliminary evaluation of three Fuzzbench targets finds that fuzzer restarts effectively distribute the basic block hit frequencies and boost the achieved coverage by up to 9.3%.","2023-07-17","2023-08-18 21:45:49","2023-08-18T21:45:49Z","2023-08-18 00:00:00","12–20","","","","","","Novelty Not Found","FUZZING 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Citation Key: schillerNoveltyNotFound2023","","","","","Fuzzing; Software Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we introduced an interactive tool called InFuzz to help humans better understand and intervene in the fuzzing process through visual bottleneck analysis. InFuzz extracts information from source code and runtime coverage and maps blocking branches in tests to source code lines, and gets potential inputs to blocking branches through dynamic data flow analysis, which are presented in the form of HTML web pages to the tester. In addition, it provides code annotation techniques to better intervene in fuzzing.

This contributes to clinical inertia and poor glycemic control. Effectiveness of traditional continuing medical education (CME) to solve that is limited, so new approaches are required. Electronic games are a good option, as they can be very effective and easily disseminated. Objective: The objective of our study was to assess applicability, user acceptance, and educational effectiveness of InsuOnline, an electronic serious game for medical education on insulin therapy for DM, compared with a traditional CME activity. Methods: Primary care physicians (PCPs) from South of Brazil were invited by phone or email to participate in an unblinded randomized controlled trial and randomly allocated to play the game InsuOnline, installed as an app in their own computers, at the time of their choice, with minimal or no external guidance, or to participate in a traditional CME session, composed by onsite lectures and cases discussion. Both interventions had the same content and duration (~4 h). Applicability was assessed by the number of subjects who completed the assigned intervention in each group. Insulin-prescribing competence (factual knowledge, problem-solving skills, and attitudes) was self-assessed through a questionnaire applied before, immediately after, and 3 months after the interventions. Acceptance of the intervention (satisfaction and perceived importance for clinical practice) was also assessed immediately after and 3 months after the interventions, respectively. Results: Subjects’ characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 38, 51.4% [69/134] male). In the game group, 69 of 88 (78%) completed the intervention, compared with 65 of 73 (89%) in the control group, with no difference in applicability. Percentage of right answers in the competence subscale, which was 52% at the baseline in both groups, significantly improved immediately after both interventions to 92% in the game group and to 85% in control (P<.001). After 3 months, it remained significantly higher than that at the baseline in both groups (80% in game, and 76% in control; P<.001). Absolute increase in competence score was better with the game (40%) than with traditional CME (34%; P=.01). Insulin-related attitudes were improved both after the game (significant improvement in 4 of 9 items) and after control activity (3 of 9). Both interventions were very well accepted, with most subjects rating them as “fun or pleasant,” “useful,” and “practice-changing.” Conclusions: The game InsuOnline was applicable, very well accepted, and highly effective for medical education on insulin therapy. In view of its flexibility and easy dissemination, it is a valid option for large-scale CME, potentially helping to reduce clinical inertia and to improve quality of care for DM patients.

Comorbid exercise dependence (ExD) is common in AN and associated with significantly worse symptom severity and treatment outcomes. Research points to cognitive inflexibility as a prominent executive function inefficiency and transdiagnostic etiologic and maintaining mechanism linking AN and ExD. This study will evaluate the initial efficacy of adjunctive Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT), which has been shown to produce cognitive improvements in adults with AN, in targeting cognitive inflexibility in individuals with comorbid AN and ExD. As an exploratory aim, this study also addresses the current lack of quick and cost-effective assessments of cognitive flexibility by establishing the utility of two proposed biomarkers, heart rate variability and salivary oxytocin. Method We will conduct a single-group, within-subjects trial of an established CRT protocol delivered remotely as an adjunct to inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment as usual (TAU) to adult patients (n = 42) with comorbid AN and ExD. Assessments, including self-report, neuropsychological, and biomarker measurements, will occur at three time points. Results We expect CRT to increase cognitive flexibility transdiagnostically and consequently, along with TAU, positively impact AN and ExD compulsivity and symptom severity, including weight gain. Discussion Findings will inform the development of more effective integrative interventions for AN and ExD targeting shared mechanisms and facilitate the routine assessment of cognitive flexibility as a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor across psychopathologies in clinical and research settings. Public Significance Patients with anorexia nervosa often engage in excessive exercise, leading to harmful outcomes, including increased suicidal behavior. This study examines the preliminary efficacy of an intervention that fosters flexible and holistic thinking in patients with problematic eating and exercise to, along with routine treatment, decrease harmful exercise symptoms. This study also examines new biological markers of the inflexible thinking style thought to be characteristic of anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence.","1970-01-01","2023-06-13 13:42:36","2023-06-13T13:42:36Z","2023-04-14 17:04:07","","","n/a","n/a","","","Impact of virtual adjunctive cognitive remediation therapy on cognitive flexibility and treatment outcomes in comorbid anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence as quantified using novel biomarkers","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23942","","","","life science","anorexia nervosa; cognitive flexibility; cognitive remediation therapy; exercise dependence; heart rate variability; oxytocin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2003), which found that individuals high in worry symptoms of anxiety show greater ERN amplitude than those low in worry. This research sparked a flurry of further investigations, with subsequent work proposing the ERN to be a putative neural marker for anxiety. However, almost two decades later, the robustness of the relationship between the ERN amplitude and anxiety has been called into question. As part of the #EEGManyLabs international collaborative (Pavlov et al., 2021), the proposed replication involves the collection of data from three highly-powered samples (n = 234 each) across nine collaborating sites in Germany, Norway, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, and the United States. Participants for the replication will be selected from a larger pool and assigned to the following three groups based on their scores on worry and phobia symptom scales: 1) high worry group, 2) high phobia/low worry group, and 3) low worry/phobia (control) group, with 70-80 participants in each group. All three groups of participants will complete a modified color-word Stroop task, consistent with procedures of Hajcak et al. (2003), while EEG recordings are made. As per Hajcak et al. (2003), we expect a significant main effect of group, with a larger overall ERN in the worry group than in the phobia and control groups, suggesting that enhanced sensitivity to errors is specific to worry vs. phobia. In addition to individual analyses conducted within each replicating lab, we will pool data across study sites and fit a two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. Replication of this study will help in further characterizing the ERN signal and its link to clinical phenomena.","2023","2023-05-22 13:22:57","2023-05-22T13:22:57Z","2023-05-22 13:22:57","","","","","","","Fear, Anxiety, and the Error-Related Negativity","","","","","","","","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/8q4ks Type: article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric tests to measure divergent thinking—an important component of creativity—in a way that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We administered two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We then subjected the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to examine which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. Results show that none of the pre-registered models fit the data well, an ambiguous result that leaves unanswered the question of whether intelligence and divergent thinking tests measure the same construct. Exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) measurement models of each test separately shows that the TTCT-F may not measure a coherent, unitary construct—leading to model misspecification when TTCT-F subtests were included in larger models.

According to this framework, choices are preceded by affective, integrative, and motivational processes, which may all be affected by aging. The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task allows tapping into several mechanisms proposed by the AIM framework, and the present registered report aimed to explore the temporal resolution of the EEG to find the neural correlates of age differences in such mechanisms, including gain/loss anticipation, value integration, motivational processes underlying motor choice, as well as processing of positive/negative rewards. The electrophysiological data were recorded from 77 participants (20–80 years old), and we analyzed the Cue-P3, Contingent Negative Variation, target-P3, Feedback-related Negativity, and the Feedback-P3. The results support the AIM framework, suggesting that aging altered affective processes (as shown by a significant reduced cue-P3 in the older group), while preserved integration and motivation processes. However, despite a general lack of significant group by domain interactions across the ERPs analyzed, the results of the planned comparisons are suggestive of a preserved processing of gains and affected processing of losses during aging. This conclusion requires further replication with larger samples, but our study shows that future research may profit from decomposing decision processes to understand how biological aging affects decision making.","2022-08-01","2023-02-24 21:35:42","2023-02-24T21:35:42Z","2023-02-24 21:35:42","119189","","","256","","NeuroImage","Neurophysiological examination of the Affect–Integratio–Motivation framework of decision-making in the aging brain","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Aging; Economic decision-making; Event-related potentials; Feedback processing; Rewards anticipation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a multi-site experiment spanning 22 countries on six continents, participants (N = 23,929) completed self-report (N = 17,591) and behavioural (N = 12,638) measures of trust in leaders who endorsed utilitarian or non-utilitarian principles in dilemmas concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent work has questioned the uniqueness of moral distress in predicting self-reported feelings of sexual addiction, demonstrating that other so-called addictive behaviors (e.g., gaming and internet use) are well-predicted by moral disapproval of those behaviors. The present work tested if moral incongruence (the interaction of behavioral frequency and moral disapproval of a behavior) is uniquely related to sexual behavior, or if it generalizes to other addictions as well. Method: This work used a large sample (N = 4,363) involving a representative sample of the U.S. population (n = 2,806) and a sample of sports-wagering individuals in the U.S. (n = 1,557). Interactions between moral disapproval and behavioral frequency were tested for several behaviors (i.e., pornography use, gambling, and several substances). Results: The interaction of behavioral frequency and behavioral disapproval (i.e., moral incongruence) predicted self-reported feelings of addiction to pornography and gambling. Moral incongruence was consistently unrelated to self-reported feelings of addiction to tobacco, illicit substances, and prescription drugs. Results regarding alcohol and marijuana were inconclusive. Conclusions: Moral incongruence is clearly a salient factor in understanding compulsive sexual behavior, and it appears to also be salient to gambling disorder. Though moral incongruence does not seem relevant to some substances (i.e., nicotine, prescription drug misuse, or illicit drug use), further research is needed regarding the effect of moral incongruence on self-reported feelings of addiction to alcohol and marijuana.

Under which conditions does “ingroup love” turn into “outgroup hate”? Studies with natural groups suggest that when group membership is based on (dis)similarity of moral beliefs, people are willing to not only help the ingroup, but also harm the outgroup. The key limitation of these studies is that the use of natural groups confounds the effects of shared morality with the history of intergroup relations. We tested the effect of morality-based group membership on intergroup behavior using artificial groups that help disentangling these effects. We used the recently developed Intergroup Parochial and Universal Cooperation (IPUC) game which differentiates between behavioral options of weak parochialism (helping the ingroup), strong parochialism (harming the outgroup), universal cooperation (helping both groups), and egoism (profiting individually). In three preregistered experiments, we find that morality-based groups exhibit less egoism and more universal cooperation than non-morality-based groups. We also find some evidence of stronger ingroup favoritism in morality-based groups, but no evidence of stronger outgroup hostility. Stronger ingroup favoritism in morality-based groups is driven by expectations from the ingroup, but not the outgroup. These findings contradict earlier evidence from natural groups and suggest that (dis)similarity of moral beliefs is not sufficient to cross the boundary between “ingroup love” and “outgroup hate”.","2023-03-01","2023-02-24 18:01:51","2023-02-24T18:01:51Z","2023-02-24 18:01:51","104436","","","105","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Helping the ingroup versus harming the outgroup","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cooperation; Economic game; Ingroup bias; Morality; Prejudice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Other theories suggest that sleep's role in memory is not restricted to consolidation. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that new learning is implemented in the brain through strengthening synaptic connections, a biologically costly process that gradually saturates encoding capacity during wake. During slow-wave sleep, synaptic strength is renormalized, thus restoring memory encoding ability. While the role of sleep in memory consolidation has been extensively documented, few human studies have explored the impact of sleep in restoring encoding ability, and none have looked at learning beyond episodic memory. In this registered report we test the predictions made by the complementary learning systems accounts and the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis regarding adult participants' ability to learn new words, and to integrate these words with existing knowledge. Participants took a polysomnographically-monitored daytime nap or remained awake prior to learning a set of new spoken words. Shortly after learning, and again on the following day, we measured participants' episodic memory for new words. We also assessed the degree to which newly learned words engage in competition with existing words. We predicted that sleep before encoding would result in better episodic memory for the words, and facilitate the overnight integration of new words with existing words. Based on existing literature and theory we further predicted that this restorative function is associated with slow-wave and sleep spindle activity. Our pre-registered analyses did not find a significant benefit of napping prior to encoding on word learning or integration. Exploratory analyses using a more sensitive measure of recall accuracy demonstrated significantly better performance in the nap condition compared to the no-nap condition in the immediate test. At the delayed test there was no longer a significant benefit of the nap. Of note, we found no significant effect of slow-wave activity prior to encoding on episodic memory or integration of newly learned words into the mental lexicon. However, we found that greater levels of Stage 2 sleep spindles were significantly associated with greater improvements in lexical competition from the immediate to the delayed test. Therefore, our results demonstrate some support for theories that implicate sleep spindles in restoring encoding capacity.","2023-02-01","2023-02-24 16:41:28","2023-02-24T16:41:28Z","2023-02-24 16:41:28","142-166","","","159","","Cortex","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Complementary learning systems; Daytime napping; Language learning; Sleep; Synaptic homeostasis hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Process–related research has started to provide more insight into how agreeableness–related traits give rise to various antisocial and prosocial behaviours.

Many accounts predict that human prosociality would increase in the presence of observing individuals. Previous studies on this observability effect predominantly relied on artificial observability manipulations and low-cost measures of prosociality. In the present Registered Report, we used a recently validated laboratory procedure of repeated dilemmas to test whether the presence of actual observers affects costly prosocial behaviour in the domain of environmental conservation. When completing this dilemma task, participants repeatedly chose between minimizing the length of the laboratory session and minimising wasted energy from a bank of LED lights. Their choices were made either in private or in the presence of actual observers. Contrary to our expectation, we did not observe higher rates of energy-conserving behaviour when participants' choices were being observed. Manipulation and robustness checks indicate that this lack of a finding is unlikely to be owing to arbitrary methodological choices. In view of these findings, we argue that a more comprehensive analysis of situation- and behaviour-specific consequences might be necessary to predict how particular behaviours are affected by observability.","","2021-03-10 09:59:26","2021-03-10T09:59:26Z","2021-03-03 15:00:22","190189","","4","7","","Royal Society Open Science","Green when seen?","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00006  Publisher: Royal Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By contrast, unfamiliar faces are encountered only once, and so they do not benefit from such richness of experience and are represented based on image-specific details. In this registered report, we used a repeat detection task to test whether familiar faces are recognized better than unfamiliar faces across image changes. Participants viewed a stream of more than 1000 celebrity face images for 0.5 s each, any of which might be repeated at a later point and has to be detected. Some participants saw the same image at repeats, while others saw a different image of the same face. A post-experimental familiarity check allowed us to determine which celebrities were and were not familiar to each participant. We had three predictions: (i) detection would be better for familiar than unfamiliar faces, (ii) detection would be better across same rather than different images, and (iii) detection of familiar faces would be comparable across same and different images, but detection of unfamiliar faces would be poorer across different images. We obtained support for the first two predictions but not the last. Instead, we found that repeat detection of faces, regardless of familiarity, was poorer across different images. Our study suggests that the robustness of familiar face recognition may have limits, and that under some conditions, familiar face recognition can be just as influenced by image changes as unfamiliar face recognition.","2018-05-01","2021-01-06 14:43:18","2021-01-06T14:43:18Z","2018-06-05 12:51:01","170634","","5","5","","","How robust is familiar face recognition?","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

In the original studies, individuals with higher socioeconomic status have been shown to behave less prosocially across a variety of domains. This finding continues to influence both research and the public debate on the psychological correlates of social class. At the same time, the validity of the original findings has been contested. Against this background, pre-registered direct replication studies with sufficient statistical power are warranted to test the robustness of these influential findings. We conducted two replication studies to provide valuable diagnostic information with regard to the relationship between social class and prosocial behavior. Our results indicate that the generalizability of the original findings may be much more limited than suggested. In addition, they highlight the need for an increased reliance on psychometrically established measures to facilitate cumulative research on the relationship between social class and prosocial behavior.","2020-02-01","2020-06-02 12:31:51","2020-06-02T12:31:51Z","2020-03-18 18:49:22","103902","","","84","","Journal of Research in Personality","Having less, giving more?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/324mn","","","","","Prosocial behavior; Replication; Social class; Socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(1946) has widely been cited as providing evidence for a primacy-of-warmth effect, suggesting that warmth-related judgments have a stronger influence on impressions of personality than competence-related judgments (e.g., Fiske, Cuddy,  Wojciszke, 2005). Because this effect does not fit with Asch?s Gestalt-view on impression formation and does not readily follow from the data presented in his original paper, the goal of the present study was to critically examine and replicate the studies of Asch?s paper that are most relevant to the primacy-of-warmth effect. We found no evidence for a primacy-of-warmth effect. Instead, the role of warmth was highly context-dependent, and competence was at least as important in shaping impressions as warmth.","2014-01-01","2019-10-31 20:42:30","2019-10-31T20:42:30Z","2016-05-18 00:00:00","153-163","","3","45","","Social Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: nauts_forming_2014 00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kornell and Bjork (2008) asked participants to learn new painting styles either by presenting different paintings of the same artist consecutively (massed presentation) or by mixing paintings of different artists (spaced presentation). In their second experiment, Kornell and Bjork showed with a final style recognition test, that spacing resulted in better inductive learning than massing. Also, by using this style recognition test, they ruled out the possibility that spacing merely resulted in a better memory for the labels of the newly learned painting styles. The findings from Kornell and Bjork’s second experiment are important because they show that the benefit of spaced learning generalizes to complex learning tasks and outcomes, and that it is not confined to rote memory learning. However, the findings from Kornell and Bjork’s second experiment have never been replicated. In the present study we performed an exact and high-powered replication of Kornell and Bjork’s second experiment with a Web-based sample. Such a replication contributes to establish the reliability of the original finding and hence to more conclusive evidence of the spacing effect in inductive learning. The findings from the present replication attempt revealed a medium-sized advantage of spacing over massing in inductive learning, which was comparable to the original effect in the experiment by Kornell and Bjork. Also, the 95% confidence intervals of the effect sizes from both experiments overlapped considerably. Hence, the findings from the present replication experiment and the original experiment clearly reinforce each other.","2014-03-31","2019-10-31 20:42:28","2019-10-31T20:42:28Z","2017-05-05 12:57:54","","","","5","","Front.

In short, attentional selection in the past hinders voluntary control of attention in the present. But do such enduring attentional biases rely on a history of voluntary, goal-directed attentional selection, or can they be generated through involuntary, effortless attentional allocation? An abrupt visual onset triggers such a reflexive allocation of covert spatial attention to its location in the visual field, automatically modulating numerous aspects of visual perception. In this Registered Report, we asked whether a selection history that has been reflexively and involuntarily derived (i.e., through abrupt-onset cueing) also interferes with goal-directed attentional control, even in the complete absence of exogenous cues. To build spatially distinct histories of exogenous selection, we presented abrupt-onset cues twice as often at one of two task locations, and as expected, these cues reflexively modulated visual processing: task accuracy increased, and response times (RTs) decreased, when the cue appeared near the target’s location, relative to that of the distractor. Upon removal of these cues, however, we found no evidence that exogenous selection history modulated task performance: task accuracy and RTs at the previously most-cued and previously least-cued sides were statistically indistinguishable. Thus, unlike voluntarily directed attention, involuntary attentional allocation may not be sufficient to engender historically contingent selection biases.","2019-03-28","2019-10-31 20:39:05","2019-10-31T20:39:05Z","2019-04-16 18:21:52","","","","","","Psychon Bull Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Exogenous attention; Selection history; Spatial attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
