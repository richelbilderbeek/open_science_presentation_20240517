Existing research has used cross-sectional designs with easy-to-obtain but unreliable self-report measures of playtime, or, in rare instances, obtained industry data on objectively-tracked playtime but only for individual games, not a player’s total playtime across games. Further, researchers have raised concerns that publication bias and a lack of differentiation between exploratory and confirmatory research have undermined the credibility of the evidence base. As a result, we still do not know whether wellbeing affects playtime, playtime affects wellbeing, both, or neither. To track people’s playtime across multiple games, we developed a method to log playtime on the Xbox platform. In a 12-week, 6-wave panel study of adult US/UK Xbox-predominant players (414 players, 2036 completed surveys), we investigated within-person temporal relations between objectively-measured playtime and wellbeing. Across multiple preregistered model specifications, we found that the within-person prospective relationships between playtime and wellbeing, or vice versa, were not practically significant—even the largest associations were unlikely to register a perceptible impact on a player’s wellbeing.  These results support the growing body of evidence that playtime is not the primary factor in the relationship between gaming and mental health for the majority of players, and that research focus should be on the context and quality of gameplay instead.","2024-01-12","2024-01-13 07:59:55","2024-01-13T07:59:55Z","2024-01-12 15:18:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-us","","","","","osf.io","","Publisher: OSF Citation Key: Ballou-2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite extensive research on the costs and benefits of these states, our understanding of the relationship between mind-wandering, boredom, attention, and memory remains limited. In the proposed study, we wish to examine the impact that mind-wandering and boredom during encoding have on recognition. In particular, we seek to investigate what impact mind-wandering and boredom have during the encoding of visual material on the pupil old/new effect at recognition of the same material. We will use an incidental memory task and measure mind-wandering and boredom with thought probes during encoding. Furthermore, we will use the pupil old/new effect assessed via eye-tracking as a measure of recognition. Will old stimuli encoded during mind-wandering and boredom elicit the same pupillary response as new stimuli, or will the pupil, during recognition, still recognize the stimulus as an old one? We predict that the encoding of stimuli during mind-wandering and boredom reduces the pupil old-new effect, in other words, we expect the difference between the pupil size during old and new stimuli to be diminished. Furthermore, we expect mind-wandering to be a better predictor than boredom.","2024","2024-01-13 07:59:46","2024-01-13T07:59:46Z","2024-01-12 16:06:11","","","","","","","Registered report (Stage 1 - preprint)","","","","","","","","","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/gue36 Type: article Citation Key: Lapteva-2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers using these models often consult highly-referenced simulation studies when designing their own studies, especially for sample-size planning. However, current literature suggests two issues with this practice. First, recent efforts to replicate findings from seminal simulation studies suggest the rate of replicability is far from ideal. Second, with the growing popularity of multilevel models, researchers are now using more complex models; however, they often support their usage by referring to simulation studies conducted under much simpler conditions. To address these two issues, we propose a replication and extension of Maas &amp; Hox (2005), a widely cited study that recommended Level-2 sample sizes of N = 50 to be sufficient under specific conditions. We replicate their original core findings and propose several extensions based on a literature search of multilevel modeling practices employed in fifty recently published studies. These extensions include examining conditions with imbalanced data across higher-level units, varying the number of random slopes and cross-level interactions, and varying effect sizes. Together, these results could ensure much of the existing literature relies on a replicable simulation study while also helping inform multilevel study planning for complex models which are becoming increasingly popular in behavioral and social sciences.","2023","2023-11-10 15:37:34","2023-11-10T15:37:34Z","2023-11-10 15:36:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/fk8jz Type: article Citation Key: GuassiMoreira-2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To dig deeper into the contours of when (and among whom) negativity bias predicts conservatism, we investigate a surprisingly overlooked factor in existing literature: race and ethnicity. We propose that political issues represent threat or disgust in different ways depending on one’s race and ethnicity.

Results have largely been interpreted as suggesting that the behavioral immune system influences preferences for these features in potential mates. However, findings are limited by small sample sizes among studies reporting supportive evidence, the use of small stimulus sets to assess preferences for symmetry and dimorphism, and design features that render implications for theory ambiguous (namely, largely only investigating women's preferences for male faces). Using a sample of 954 White young adult UK participants and a pool of 100 White young adult stimuli, the current registered report applied a standard two-alternative forced-choice approach to evaluate both men's and women's preferences for both facial symmetry and dimorphism in both same- and opposite-sex targets. Participants were randomly assigned to either a pathogen prime or a control prime, and they completed instruments assessing individual differences in pathogen avoidance (disgust sensitivity and contamination sensitivity). Results revealed overall preferences for both facial symmetry and dimorphism. However, they did not reveal a relation between these preferences and disgust sensitivity or contamination sensitivity, nor did they reveal differences in these preferences across control and pathogen prime conditions. Null results of pathogen-avoidance variables were consistent across participant sex, target sex, and interactions between participant sex and target sex. Overall, findings cast doubt on the hypothesis that pathogen-avoidance motives influence preferences for facial symmetry or dimorphism.","2022-05-01","2023-06-13 13:25:48","2023-06-13T13:25:48Z","2023-03-01 19:02:55","212-223","","3","43","","Evolution and Human Behavior","Re-evaluating the relationship between pathogen avoidance and preferences for facial symmetry and sexual dimorphism","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","life science","Behavioral immune system; Disgust; Health; Masculinity; Mate preferences; Symmetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce treatment failures by proactively screening for patients at risk of low treatment response, gain more knowledge about risk factors, and to evaluate treatments, accurate insights about predictors of treatment response in naturalistic inpatient samples are needed. Methods We will compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting treatment response, operationalized as a substantial reduction in symptom severity as expressed in the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. To achieve this goal, we will use different sets of variables-(a) demographics, (b) medical indicators, (c) psychological indicators, and (d) treatment-related variables-in an inpatient sample to specify their joint and unique contribution to treatment success.","2022-12-22","2023-03-01 19:03:03","2023-03-01T19:03:03Z","","","","","","","","Predicting Treatment Response Using Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/fuyjv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although heavily influential, a frequent question raised is whether responses to hypothetical scenarios are informative about instances of morally relevant behavior. Using the CNI model to quantify sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms, and general preference for inaction versus action in responses to sacrificial dilemmas, two preregistered studies examined whether specific factors underlying sacrificial dilemma judgments predict dishonest behavior for personal monetary gain (Study 1) and the greater good (Study 2). Testing the hypothesis that specific factors underlying sacrificial dilemma judgments are linked to other morally relevant behaviors via broader underlying moral dispositions, confirmatory tests provide strong support the predicted associations between sensitivity to moral norms and dishonest behavior.

Recent research shows that sexual violence (versus other, less stigmatizing trauma) stories are perceived as more difficult to tell, and their storytellers as less likeable. This is true even when stories have redemptive endings, contradicting an established U.S. cultural preference for redemptive stories. However, it is unknown if sexual violence perceptions generalize to different types of interpersonal violence (IPV) and if audience perceptions vary across 3 major types of IPV (sexual, physical, psychological). This pre-registered replication and extension study investigates these questions with a vignette-based experimental design modeled after 2 published studies by the first and last authors. Broadly, we hypothesized that cultural invalidation of sexual violence stories would extend to any IPV story (vs. non-IPV traumas such as natural disasters), and that within the realm of IPV, cultural invalidation would be more pronounced for psychological violence stories (vs. sexual/physical). Three samples of U.S. adult participants (N=1,045), 2 Nationally Representative and 1 University-based, were randomly assigned online to read 1 of 12 first-person trauma story vignettes and complete self-report surveys of story and storyteller perceptions in a 6 (trauma story: IPV [k=3], non-IPV [k=3]) x 2 (ending: negative, redemptive) between-subjects design. Support for our hypotheses was mixed. IPV (vs. non-IPV) stories were perceived as more difficult to share (η2p = .068) and their storytellers as having less positive personality traits (η2p = .043), even when stories ended redemptively. However, among the 3 IPV types, psychological violence storytellers were not robustly more stigmatized, and sexual violence stories were recognized as particularly difficult to disclose. IPV survivors face obstacles to telling their stories that may hamper both personal recovery and collective momentum for systemic change.","2022-08-02","2023-02-24 21:45:23","2023-02-24T21:45:23Z","2023-02-24 21:45:23","36330","","1","8","","Collabra: Psychology","Perceptions of Physical, Sexual, and Psychological Violence Stories","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A critical area in this regard is the lack of clarity concerning the differences between gaming disorder and intensive play, the latter of which often involves several gaming hours per day without related health problems. In this study, we approached the above question by interpretive phenomenological analysis with interviews in two groups of highly involved videogame players: those who seek or have sought clinical help for their problems with gaming (n=6), and those who play esports more than 4 hours per day without self-reported related health problems (n=10). The interviews were carried out by using a new Phenomenology of Play (POP) interview frame. These data were contextualized with interviews of medical experts (n=6) who have experience of working with the former group. The findings imply that experiences of disorder derive from gaming interfering with what one wants to be, do, and have throughout life, whereas the experiences of intensive esport play derive from gaming being integrated into self throughout life. To our knowledge, this was the first registered report using qualitative phenomenological methods—we encourage researchers to explore the utility of registered reports with other qualitative methods to further optimize scientific progress.","2022-10-24","2023-02-24 21:35:37","2023-02-24T21:35:37Z","2023-02-24 21:35:33","38819","","1","8","","Collabra: Psychology","Phenomenological Strands for Gaming Disorder and Esports Play","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal was to investigate how screening instruments that derive from different ontologies differ in identifying associated problem groups. By using four central screening instruments, each representing a different ontological basis, we hypothesized differences and similarities in prevalence, overlap, and health. A nationally representative (N = 8217) sample of Finnish participants was collected. The screening instruments produced significantly different prevalence rates (from 0.4% to 6.9%) and the binomial probabilities of group overlap ranged from poor (0.419) to good (0.919). Expectedly, the problem groups had lower mental health than the general population, yet exploratory analyses implied equivalent or significantly higher physical health. We also found strong exploratory evidence for mischievous responding to complicate the measurement of gaming problems. Considering that several major differences were confirmed between the four gaming problem constructs, we recommend researchers to clearly define their construct of interest, i.e. whether they are studying the ICD-11 based official mental disorder, the DSM-5 proposed ‘internet gaming disorder’, or other gaming problems—especially in future meta-analyses.","2022-09-05","2023-02-24 19:12:30","2023-02-24T19:12:30Z","2023-02-24 19:12:30","1-11","","0","0","","","Ontological diversity in gaming disorder measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/16066359.2022.2115033","","","","","Behavioral addiction; games; open science; philosophy; prevalence; technology use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not clear whether the same effects would be obtained also by just imagining, rather than adopting, a power pose. We planned to investigate this question by asking 200 participants to either perform or imagine a constrictive or an expansive body posture during 2 min and then measure the effect on a gambling decision task and on felt power. We followed a sequential analysis procedure by running the first 100 participants in the performed posture condition in order to check the presence of the power posing effect. Because no effect of power poses on gambling decision or on felt power was found, we ran the remaining 100 participants also in the performed instead of the imagined condition. The results after running 200 participants confirmed that power poses did not affect gambling decision. However, participants felt more powerful after adopting an expansive pose compared to a constrictive pose. Exploratory analyses found that this effect was mainly driven by male participants. In addition, participants rated themselves as being more able to adopt the expansive body posture and they reported to put more effort in adopting the restrictive body posture. Overall, our results indicate that the effect of power poses on behavior might not be as widespread as previously thought of and suggest that moderators should be investigated carefully in future research.","2017-01-02","2019-10-31 20:33:46","2019-10-31T20:33:46Z","","44-54","","1","2","","","Real and imagined power poses","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","","","","Power pose; felt power; gambling decision; imagined pose; performed pose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
