These effects are some of the most well studied phenomena in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision making. Recent research in this area has revealed an intriguing pattern of results. On the one hand, these effects are robust and ubiquitous. That is, they have been demonstrated in many domains and different choice settings. On the other hand, they are fragile and they disappear or even reverse under different conditions. This pattern of results has spurred debate and speculation about the cognitive mechanisms that drive these choices. The attraction effect, where the preference for an option increases in the presence of a dominated decoy, has generated the most controversy. In this registered report, we systematically vary factors that are known to be associated with the attraction effect to build a solid foundation of empirical results to aid future theory development. We find a robust attraction effect across the different conditions. The strength of this effect is modulated by the display order (e.g., decoy top, target middle, competitor bottom) and mode (numeric vs. graphical) but not display layout (by-attribute vs. by-alternative).",2024-01-12,2024-01-13 08:00:01,2024-01-13T08:00:01Z,2024-01-12 14:53:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en-us,,,,,osf.io,,Publisher: OSF Citation Key: Hasan-2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, less is known about the effect of sleep on false memory, where people incorrectly remember events that never occurred. In the laboratory, false memories are often induced via the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm where participants are presented with wordlists comprising semantically related words such as               nurse               ,               hospital               and               sick               (studied words). Subsequently, participants are likely to falsely remember that a related lure word such as               doctor               was presented. Multiple studies have examined whether these false memories are influenced by sleep, with contradictory results. A recent meta-analysis suggests that sleep may increase DRM false memory when short lists are used. We tested this in a registered report (               N               = 488) with a 2 (Interval: Immediate versus 12 h delay) × 2 (Test Time: 9:00 versus 21:00) between-participant DRM experiment, using short DRM lists (               N               = 8 words/list) and free recall as the memory test. We found an unexpected time-of-day effect such that completing free recall in the evening led to more intrusions (neither studied nor lure words). Above and beyond this time-of-day effect, the Sleep participants produced fewer intrusions than their Wake counterparts. When this was statistically controlled for, the Sleep participants falsely produced more critical lures. They also correctly recalled more studied words (regardless of intrusions). Exploratory analysis showed that these findings cannot be attributed to differences in output bias, as indexed by the number of total responses. Our overall results cannot be fully captured by existing sleep-specific theories of false memory, but help to define the role of sleep in two more general theories (Fuzzy-Trace and Activation/Monitoring theories) and suggest that sleep may benefit gist abstraction/spreading activation on one hand and memory suppression/source monitoring on the other.",2023-12,2024-01-13 07:59:56,2024-01-13T07:59:56Z,2024-01-12 15:14:45,220595,,12,10,,R.

Recommendations on walking and mask wearing for older adults have been debated, with no clear consensus on the various factors interacting and influencing walking safety while wearing a face mask. It is particularly important to address this issue in populations at an increased risk of falls. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of mask-wearing on objectively measured walking adaptability in people with Parkinson’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis. Methods 50 patients with either Parkinson’s disease or Multiple Sclerosis attending inpatient neurorehabilitation will be recruited to participate in this crossover study. Performance during a standardized gait adaptability (C-Gait) test on a VR-based treadmill (C-Mill+VR), as well as during clinical mobility tests (10-meter walk test, Timed Up & Go test, and stair ambulation) will be measured with and without an FFP2- mask (order randomized). In addition, participants will be asked about their perceived performance and perceived safety during the tests with and without a mask. Performance on the seven C-Gait subtests is based on centre of pressure-derived measures of foot placement in relation to the different tasks. These are averaged and added to a cognitive C-Gait task to give the overall composite score (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes will include the different subscores and clinical mobility tests. Potential significance This study will make an important contribution to an ongoing debate regarding recommendations persons with and without a neurological disease should be given regarding wearing a face mask while walking. Furthermore, the study will complement the existing scientific discourse with clinical data from people with a neurological disease for whom falls, mobility deficits and mask wearing may be more frequent, which can help inform evidence-based recommendations.

However, the extent to which adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) cause mental health problems remains unclear, as previous associations may partly reflect genetic confounding. In this Registered Report, we used DNA from 11,407 children from the United Kingdom and the United States to investigate gene–environment correlations and genetic confounding of the associations between ACEs and mental health. Regarding gene–environment correlations, children with higher polygenic scores for mental health problems had a small increase in odds of ACEs. Regarding genetic confounding, elevated risk of mental health problems in children exposed to ACEs was at least partially due to pre-existing genetic risk. However, some ACEs (such as childhood maltreatment and parental mental illness) remained associated with mental health problems independent of genetic confounding. These findings suggest that interventions addressing heritable psychiatric vulnerabilities in children exposed to ACEs may help reduce their risk of mental health problems.",2023-02,2023-06-13 16:20:56,2023-06-13T16:20:56Z,2023-02-24 21:19:40,269-290,,2,7,,Nat Hum Behav,,,,,,,,en,"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 2 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,life science,Genetics; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobile health (mHealth) weight loss interventions can reduce chronic disease risks, but these are untested in Filipino Americans with T2D. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and potential efficacy of a pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally adapted mHealth weight loss lifestyle intervention (Pilipino Americans Go4Health [PilAm Go4Health]) for overweight Filipino Americans with T2D. Methods: This was a 2-arm pilot RCT of the 3-month PilAm Go4Health intervention (phase 1) with an active waitlist control and 3-month follow-up (phase 2). The waitlist control received the PilAm Go4Health in phase 2, whereas the intervention group transitioned to the 3-month follow-up. PilAm Go4Health incorporated a Fitbit accelerometer, mobile app with diary for health behavior tracking (steps, food/calories, and weight), and social media (Facebook) for virtual social support, including 7 in-person monthly meetings. Filipino American adults ≥18 years with T2D were recruited from Northern California. Feasibility was measured by rates of recruitment, engagement, and retention. Multilevel regression analyses assessed within and between group differences for the secondary outcome of percent weight change and other outcomes of weight (kg), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and steps. Results: A total of 45 Filipino American adults were enrolled and randomized. Mean age was 58 (SD 10) years, 62% (28/45) were women, and mean BMI was 30.1 (SD 4.6). Participant retention and study completion were 100%, with both the intervention and waitlist group achieving near-perfect attendance at all 7 intervention office visits. Groups receiving the PilAm Go4Health in phase 1 (intervention group) and phase 2 (waitlist group) had significantly greater weight loss, −2.6% (−3.9 to −1.4) and −3.3% (−1.8 to −4.8), respectively, compared with the nonintervention group, resulting in a moderate to small effect sizes (d=0.53 and 0.37, respectively). In phase 1, 18% (4/22) of the intervention group achieved a 5% weight loss, whereas 82% (18/22) maintained or lost 2% to 5% of their weight and continued to maintain this weight loss in the 3-month follow-up. Other health outcomes, including waist circumference, BMI, and step counts, improved when each arm received the PilAm Go4Health, but the fasting glucose and HbA1c outcomes were mixed. Conclusions: The PilAm Go4Health was feasible and demonstrated potential efficacy in reducing diabetes risks in overweight Filipino Americans with T2D. This study supports the use of mHealth and other promising intervention strategies to reduce obesity and diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Further testing in a full-scale RCT is warranted. These findings may support intervention translation to reduce diabetes risks in other at-risk diverse populations.

The aim of the current research is to explore trait anxiety and differences in saccadic and keypress responding as potential determinants of performance on flexibility tasks in AN. Method We will compare performance on the mixed pro- anti-saccade paradigm between female adult participants with a current diagnosis of AN and matched control participants, observing both saccadic and keypress responses while controlling for trait anxiety (State - Trait Anxiety Inventory) and spatial working memory (Corsi Block Tapping Test). Associations with eating disorder-related symptoms (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire), flexibility in everyday life (Eating Disorder Flexibility Index), and the Clinical Perfectionism Questionnaire will also be assessed. Results Data which controls for individual differences in trait anxiety and assesses flexibility at both the task- and response-set level may be used to more accurately understand differences in performance on cognitive flexibility tasks by participants with AN. Discussion Clarifying the effects of trait anxiety on flexibility, and differences between task- and response-set switching may advance our understanding of how cognitive flexibility relates to flexibility in everyday life and improve translation to therapeutic approaches. Public significance statement This research will compare performance on a flexibility task between participants with anorexia nervosa (AN) and controls while observing their eye-movements to examine whether trait anxiety and type of response (eye-movement and keypress) are associated with performance. This data may improve our understanding of why participants with AN perform more poorly on cognitive flexibility tasks, and how poor cognitive flexibility relates to eating disorder-related issues with flexibility in everyday life.",2022,2023-06-13 16:12:55,2023-06-13T16:12:55Z,2023-02-24 21:39:28,1411-1417,,10,55,,,Assessing cognitive flexibility in anorexia nervosa using eye tracking,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23779,,,,life science,anorexia nervosa; anti-saccade; clinical perfectionism; cognitive flexibility; eating disorders; eye movements; eye-tracking; task switching; trait anxiety; working memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study tests an existing hypothesis that has been proposed to explain such biases: the mind has evolved to interpret outgroup membership as a cue to pathogen threat. In this registered report, we test a core feature of this hypothesis. Adapting methods from earlier work, we examine (1) whether people are less comfortable with microbe-sharing contact with an ethnic outgroup member than an ethnic ingroup member, and (2) whether this difference is exacerbated by additional visual cues to a target's infectiousness. Using Chinese (N = 1533) and British (N = 1371) samples recruited from the online platforms WJX and Prolific, we assessed contact comfort with targets who were either East Asian or White and who were either modified to have symptoms of infection or unmodified (or, for exploratory purposes, modified to wear facemasks). Contact comfort was lower for targets modified to have symptoms of infection. However, we detected no differences in contact comfort with ethnic-ingroup targets versus ethnic-outgroup targets. These results do not support the hypothesis that people interpret ethnic outgroup membership alone as a cue to infection risk.",2022-11-01,2023-06-13 15:25:16,2023-06-13T15:25:16Z,2023-02-24 21:40:21,490-500,,6,43,,Evolution and Human Behavior,Are people more averse to microbe-sharing contact with ethnic outgroup members?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,life science,Behavioral immune system; Disgust; Pathogens; Xenophobia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence suggests cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be useful in the post-acute period, but few patients have access to trained providers. mHealth technologies have potential to increase access to high-quality care for AN, including in the post-acute period. The aim of this study is to estimate the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU), offered with and without an accompanying social networking feature. Method In the current pilot randomized controlled trial, women with AN who have been discharged from acute treatment in the past 2 months (N = 90) will be randomly assigned to a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU), a CBT-based mobile intervention including social networking plus TAU, or TAU alone. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the three conditions in terms of reducing eating disorder psychopathology, reducing frequency of eating disorder behaviors, achieving weight maintenance, reducing depression and suicidal ideation, and reducing clinical impairment. We will examine rehospitalization and full recovery rates in an exploratory fashion. We will also examine whether the mobile intervention and social networking feature change the proposed targets and whether changes in targets are associated with benefit, as well as conduct exploratory analyses to identify within-mobile intervention predictors and moderators of outcome. Discussion Ultimately, this research may lead to increased access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with AN and prevention of the extreme negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder. Public Significance Relapse after acute treatment for anorexia nervosa is common, and few patients have access to trained providers to support them following acute care. This study will pilot a coached mobile app, including a social networking component, for this population. If ultimately successful, our approach could greatly increase access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with anorexia nervosa and ultimately prevent the extreme negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder.",1970-01-01,2023-06-13 15:24:45,2023-06-13T15:24:45Z,2023-02-24 14:45:20,,,n/a,n/a,,,A pilot randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral therapy-guided self-help mobile app for the post-acute treatment of anorexia nervosa,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23891,,,,life science,anorexia nervosa; eating disorders; mobile intervention; post-acute treatment; social networking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to use this information to implement evidence-based interventions, these results have to be available to skilled health providers at the point of delivery. Most electronic health platforms are dependent on the availability of reliable Internet connectivity and, thus, have limited use in many rural and resource-limited settings. Objective: Here we describe our work on the development and deployment of an integrated mHealth platform that is able to capture medical information, including test results, and encrypt it into a patient-held smartcard that can be read at the point of delivery without the need for an Internet connection. Methods: We engaged a team of implementation scientists, public health experts, and information technology specialists in a requirement-gathering process to inform the design of a prototype for a platform that uses smartcard technology, database deployment, and mobile phone app development. Key design decisions focused on usability, scalability, and security. Results: We successfully designed an integrated mHealth platform and deployed it in 4 health facilities across Benue State, Nigeria. We developed the Vitira Health platform to store test results of HIV, HBV, and SCD in a database, and securely encrypt the results on a Quick Response code embedded on a smartcard. We used a mobile app to read the contents on the smartcard without the need for Internet connectivity. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that it is possible to develop a patient-held smartcard and an mHealth platform that contains vital health information that can be read at the point of delivery using a mobile phone-based app without an Internet connection.

Whilst there is evidence of increased uptake in these practices, such as study preregistration and open data, facilitated by new infrastructure and policies, little research has assessed general uptake of such practices across university researchers. The current study estimates psychologists’ level of engagement in open research practices across universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland, while also assessing possible explanatory factors that may impact their engagement. Data were collected from [insert final number of participants] psychology researchers in the UK and Ireland on the extent to which individual researchers have implemented various practices (e.g., use of preprints, preregistration, open data, open materials). Here we present the summarised descriptive results, as well as considering differences between various categories of researcher (e.g., career stage, subdiscipline, methodology), and examining the link between researcher’s practices and their self-reported capability, opportunity, and motivation (COM-B) to engage in open research practices. Results show [e.g., that there is wide/little variability across the discipline as well as differences between established researchers and postgraduate research students/postdoctoral researchers, who are more/less likely to be engaging in responsible research practices]. Estimating the prevalence of responsible research practices is important to assess sustained behaviour change in research reform, tailor educational training initiatives, and to understand potential factors that might impact engagement.",2023,2023-06-09 20:29:35,2023-06-09T20:29:35Z,2023-06-09 20:29:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cc by,,,,Europe PMC,,DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/b5m6q Type: article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to change practice should be informed by understanding the factors influencing prescribing. Aim: To investigate the optimal type and level of information to communicate with GPs to increase willingness to prescribe aspirin. Design and setting: We recruited GPs in England and Wales (n=672) to an online survey with a 23 factorial design. GPs were randomised to one of eight vignettes describing a hypothetical patient with Lynch syndrome recommended to take aspirin by a clinical geneticist. Method: Across the vignettes, we manipulated the presence or absence of three types of information: 1) existence of NICE guidance; 2) results from the CAPP2 trial; 3) information comparing risks/benefits of aspirin. We estimated the main effects and all interactions on the primary (willingness to prescribe) and secondary outcomes (comfort discussing aspirin). Results: There were no statistically significant main effects or interactions of the three information components on willingness to prescribe aspirin or comfort discussing harms and benefits. In total, 80.4% (540/672) of GPs were willing to prescribe, with 19.7% (132/672) unwilling. GPs with prior awareness of aspirin for preventive therapy were more comfortable discussing the medication than those unaware (p=0.031). Conclusion: It is unlikely that providing information on clinical guidance, trial results and information comparing benefits and harms will increase aspirin prescribing for Lynch Syndrome in primary care. Alternative multilevel strategies to support informed prescribing may be warranted.",2022-12-13,2023-03-01 19:02:25,2023-03-01T19:02:25Z,2023-03-01 19:02:25,,,,,,Br J Gen Pract,A factorial randomised trial investigating factors influencing general practitioners’ willingness to prescribe aspirin for cancer preventive therapy in Lynch syndrome,,,,,,,en,"Copyright © 2022, The Authors.

(2005) showed that intranasal administration of oxytocin (OT) increases the transfers made by investors in the trust game—suggesting that OT increases trust in strangers. Subsequent studies investigating the role of OT in the trust game found inconclusive effects on the trusting behaviour of investors but these studies deviated from the Kosfeld et al. study in an important way—they did not implement minimal social contact (MSC) between the investors and the trustees in the trust game. Here, we performed a large double-blind and placebo-controlled replication study of the effects of OT on trusting behaviour that yields a power of more than 95% and implements an MSC condition as well as a no-social-contact (NoC) condition. We find no effect of OT on trusting behaviour in the MSC condition. Exploratory post hoc analyses suggest that OT may increase trust in individuals with a low disposition to trust in the NoC condition, but this finding requires confirmation in future research.",2020-06,2023-02-24 21:29:47,2023-02-24T21:29:47Z,2023-02-24 21:29:47,646-655,,6,4,,Nat Hum Behav,,,,,,,,en,"2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 6 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,,Economics; Neuroscience; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we use a pupillary index to adjudicate between two existing hypotheses about how irrational biases emerge: the hypothesis that biases result from fast, effortless processing and the hypothesis that biases result from more extensive integration. While effortless processing is associated with smaller pupillary responses, more extensive integration is associated with larger pupillary responses. Thus, we tested the relationship between pupil response and choice behaviour on six different foundational decision-making tasks that are classically used to demonstrate irrational biases. Participants demonstrated the expected systematic biases and their pupillary measurements satisfied pre-specified quality checks. Planned analyses returned inconclusive results, but exploratory examination of the data revealed an association between high pupillary responses and biased decisions. The findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that biases arise from gradual information integration.",2021-05,2023-02-24 21:29:10,2023-02-24T21:29:10Z,2023-02-24 21:29:10,653-662,,5,5,,Nat Hum Behav,,,,,,,,en,"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 5 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,,Decision; Human behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the causal benefits of reducing time poverty, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment over six consecutive weeks in an urban slum in Kenya with a sample of working mothers, a population who is especially likely to experience severe time poverty. Participants received vouchers for services designed to reduce their burden of unpaid labor. We compared the effect of these vouchers against equivalently valued unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) and a neutral control condition. In contrast to our pre-registered hypotheses, a pre-registered Bayesian ANCOVA indicated that the time-saving, UCT, and control conditions led to similar increases in subjective well-being, reductions in perceived stress, and decreases in relationship conflict (Cohen’s d’s ranged from 0.25 to 0.85 during the treatment weeks and from 0.21 to 0.36 at the endline).

Resting-state neuroimaging studies have suggested these gradients can be reconstructed from patterns of functional connectivity. Here we investigate the accuracy of these reconstructions and establish whether it is connectivity or the functional properties within a region that determine these “connectopic maps”. Different manifold learning techniques were used to recover visual field maps while participants were at rest or engaged in natural viewing. We benchmarked these reconstructions against maps measured by traditional visual field mapping. We report an initial exploratory experiment of a publicly available naturalistic imaging dataset, followed by a preregistered replication using larger resting-state and naturalistic imaging datasets from the Human Connectome Project. Connectopic mapping accurately predicted visual field maps in primary visual cortex, with better predictions for eccentricity than polar angle maps. Non-linear manifold learning methods outperformed simpler linear embeddings. We also found more accurate predictions during natural viewing compared to resting-state. Varying the source of the connectivity estimates had minimal impact on the connectopic maps, suggesting the key factor is the functional topography within a brain region. The application of these standardised methods for connectopic mapping will allow the discovery of functional gradients across the brain.",2022-09-28,2023-02-24 19:14:06,2023-02-24T19:14:06Z,2023-02-24 19:14:06,16249,,1,12,,Sci Rep,,,,,,,,en,2022 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,,Computational neuroscience; Striate cortex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the question of under what conditions control threat can mobilize individuals to join problem-focused, activist groups remains unresolved. In the present research, we propose that strength of involvement in group-based actions depends on the match between the domain of a threatened control goal and the domain in which the particular group acts. First, a match can occur when the level of control threat matches (vs. does not match) the domain in which a specific group is active. Second, a match can occur when a group operates in the same domain in which the threat to control occurs (vs. in a different domain). We tested these two cases in two countries, focusing on the context of ecological threat (i.e., the air pollution problem) and environmental activism. We did not find support for the first type of match in the data. We did find, however, partial support for another type of match. Specifically, low control participants wanted to join the group and act on its behalf only when there was a match between lack of control and the activist group domain.

Although the traditional pharmacologic treatments for anxiety included barbiturates and then benzodiazepines, the introduction of tricyclic antidepressants, followed by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), marked a tidal shift in the treatment of anxiety. Although not approved for treatment of anxiety disorders (with the exception of trifluoperazine) there is ongoing off-label, unapproved use of both first-generation “typical” antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation or “atypical” antipsychotics (SGAs) for anxiety. Although there have been systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of antipsychotics in anxiety disorders, most of these reviews focused on SGAs, primarily the use of quetiapine in GAD. Given that there is little known about the potential benefits and short-and long-term risks of using antipsychotics in anxiety, there is a need for an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the use of both FGAs and SGAs in anxiety disorders.

Inconsistency across studies using one or another cortical atlas may contribute to the replication crisis across the neurosciences. Methods Here, we provide a quantitative comparison between seven popular cortical atlases (Yeo, Desikan-Killiany, Destrieux, Jülich-Brain, Gordon, Glasser, Schaefer) and vertex-wise measures (thickness, surface area, and volume), to determine which parcellation retains the most information in the analysis of behavioural traits (incl. age, sex, body mass index, and cognitive ability) in the UK Biobank sample (N∼40,000). We use linear mixed models to compare whole-brain morphometricity; the proportion of trait variance accounted for when using a given atlas. Results Commonly-used atlases resulted in a considerable loss of information compared to vertex-wise representations of cortical structure. Morphometricity increased linearly as a function of the log-number of ROIs included in an atlas, indicating atlas-based analyses miss many true associations and yield limited prediction accuracy. Likelihood ratio tests revealed that low-dimensional atlases accounted for unique trait variance rather than variance common between atlases, suggesting that previous studies likely returned atlas-specific findings. Finally, we found that the commonly-used atlases yielded brain-behaviour associations on par with those obtained with random parcellations, where specific region boundaries were randomly generated. Discussion Our findings motivate future structural neuroimaging studies to favour vertex-wise cortical representations over coarser atlases, or to consider repeating analyses across multiple atlases, should the use of low-dimensional atlases be necessary. The insights uncovered here imply that cortical atlas choices likely contribute to the lack of reproducibility in ROI-based studies.",2023-01-01,2023-02-24 16:41:53,2023-02-24T16:41:53Z,2023-02-24 16:41:53,110-126,,,158,,Cortex,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Age; Alcohol consumption; Brain structure; Cigarette smoking; Cognitive abilities; Cortical atlases; Explained variance by brain morphometry; Linear mixed models; Morphometricity; Random atlases; Sex; Structural neuroimaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some studies have reported null changes in implicit memory (e.g., priming in word-fragment completion, perceptual identification, category exemplar generation) with age, while others have uncovered declines. One factor that may account for these discrepancies is processing. Evidence suggests that conceptual and perceptual processes are not equally affected by ageing, yet processing requirements have varied greatly between studies. Processing may moderate age effects on priming, but no study has systematically examined this issue. This registered report presents an experiment to manipulate processing (conceptual / perceptual) during incidental encoding of words, prior to measures of perceptual (perceptual identification) and conceptual (category verification) priming. The perceptual and conceptual priming tasks were matched on all characteristics except processing, making them highly comparable. The four orthogonal conditions (perceptual encoding, perceptual test [PP]; conceptual encoding, perceptual test [CP]; perceptual encoding, conceptual test [PC]; conceptual encoding, conceptual test [CC]) were designed to clarify situations in which age effects on implicit memory emerge, which holds important practical and theoretical implications. Significant effects of Age, Test, and an Age ? Processing interaction emerged. Priming was greater in young than older adults and on the perceptual than the conceptual test, but in contrast to the predictions, the age difference was only significant when prior encoding was perceptual (i.e., in the PP and CP conditions).",2023-01-01,2023-02-24 16:41:48,2023-02-24T16:41:48Z,2023-02-24 16:41:48,1-14,,1,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The worst performance rule (WPR) finesses this relation by stating that the association between IQ and elementary-task performance is most pronounced when this performance is summarized by people’s slowest responses. Previous research has shown that the WPR can be accounted for in the Ratcliff diffusion model by assuming that the same ability parameter—drift rate—mediates performance in both elementary tasks and higher-level cognitive tasks. Here we aim to test four qualitative predictions concerning the WPR and its diffusion model explanation in terms of drift rate. In the first stage, the diffusion model was fit to data from 916 participants completing a perceptual two-choice task; crucially, the fitting happened after randomly shuffling the key variable, i.e., each participant’s score on a working memory capacity test. In the second stage, after all modeling decisions were made, the key variable was unshuffled and the adequacy of the predictions was evaluated by means of confirmatory Bayesian hypothesis tests. By temporarily withholding the mapping of the key predictor, we retain flexibility for proper modeling of the data (e.g., outlier exclusion) while preventing biases from unduly influencing the results.

The current research provides deeper insight into the stigmatization of single people by understanding their ‘group-y’ nature, and how group identification and perception map onto discrimination and prejudice. Study 1 examined the extent to which singles identify as part of a group. Participants were assigned a novel minimal group identity and then completed measures of group identification for four group memberships (e.g., minimal group, relationship status, sexual orientation, nationality). As hypothesized, singles' identification with other singles was lower compared to their identification with other identities—as well as compared to partnered people's group identification. Contrary to our hypothesis, singles did not perceive less discrimination towards singles relative to other aspects of their identity. Study 2 examined the extent to which singles are perceived as a group and the extent to which their group-y-ness vs. perceived responsibility for their group membership explains the acceptability of prejudice towards them. Participants completed measures of entitativity and perceived responsibility for similar out-group identities as in Study 1 (e.g., single people vs. people in romantic relationships). As hypothesized, singles were rated lower in entitativity than people in romantic relationships and other groups. Prejudice towards singles was also more acceptable than prejudice towards national and sexual orientation groups. Accordingly, perceived responsibility was a stronger predictor of the acceptability of prejudice towards singles than their entitativity.

Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we tested the existence of face-specific interindividual differences at behavioural and neural levels. The measurement models include general and face-specific factors of performance and CT. There was no face-specificity in CT in functionally localized areas. In post hoc analyses, we compared the preregistered, small regions of interest (ROIs) to larger, non-individualized ROIs and identified a face-specific CT factor when large ROIs were considered. We show that this was probably due to low reliability of CT in the functional localization (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) between 0.72 and 0.85). Furthermore, general cognitive ability, but not face-specific performance, could be predicted by latent factors of CT with a small effect size.

Interventions targeting the gut microbiota may serve as potential treatments for depression, and this drives increasing research into the effect of probiotics and prebiotics in neuropsychiatric disorders. Prebiotics, galacto-oligosaccharides and fructooligosaccharides that stimulate the activity of gut bacteria have been reported to have a positive impact, reducing anxiety and depressive-like phenotypes and stress-related physiology in mice and rats, as well as in humans.

This assumption is that multimodal integration requires consciousness; however, few studies have explicitly tested if integration can occur between nonconscious information from different modalities. The proposed study examined whether a classic indicator of multimodal integration – the McGurk effect – can be elicited with subliminal auditory-visual speech stimuli. We used a masked speech priming paradigm developed by Kouider and Dupoux (2005) in conjunction with continuous flash suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), a binocular rivalry technique for presenting video stimuli subliminally. Applying these techniques together, we carried out two experiments in which participants categorised auditory syllable targets which were preceded by subliminal auditory-visual (AV) speech primes. Subliminal AV primes were either illusion-inducing (McGurk) or illusion-neutral (Incongruent) combinations of speech stimuli. In Experiment 1, the categorisation of the syllable target (“pa”) was facilitated by the same syllable prime when it was part of a McGurk combination (auditory “pa” and visual “ka”) but not when part of an Incongruent combination (auditory “pa” and visual “wa”). This dependency on specific AV combinations indicated a nonconscious AV interaction. Experiment 2 presented a different syllable target (“ta”) which matched the predicted illusory outcome of the McGurk combination – here, both the McGurk combination (auditory “pa” and visual “ka”) and the Incongruent combination (auditory “ta” and visual “ka”) failed to facilitate target categorisation. The combined results of both Experiments demonstrate a type of nonconscious multimodal interaction that is distinct from integration – it allows unimodal information that is compatible for integration (i.e., McGurk combinations) to persist and influence later processes, but does not actually combine and alter that information. As the GWT model does not account for non-integrative multimodal interactions, this places some pressure on such models of consciousness.",2019-03-01,2019-10-31 20:39:18,2019-10-31T20:39:18Z,2019-03-11 17:59:35,,,,,,Cortex,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,00000  https://osf.io/sbntf/?view_only=12aeec9cda114f6eb138064f6c45aefe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wii Fit Balance Board is a popular gaming controller for AVGs and is used in a variety of settings. However, the commercial off-the-shelf (OTS) design poses several limitations. It is inaccessible to wheelchair users, does not support the use of stabilization assistive devices, and requires the ability to shift the center of balance (COB) in all directions to fully engage in game play. Objective: The aim of this study was to design an adapted version of the Wii Fit Balance Board to overcome the identified limitations and to evaluate the usability of the newly designed adapted Wii Fit Balance Board in persons with mobility impairments. Methods: In a previous study, 16 participants tried the OTS version of the Wii Fit Balance Board. On the basis of observed limitations, a team of engineers developed and adapted the design of the Wii Fit Balance Board, which was then subjected to multiple iterations of user feedback and design tweaks. On design completion, we recruited a new pool of participants with mobility impairments for a larger study. During their first visit, we assessed lower-extremity function using selected mobility tasks from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. During a subsequent session, participants played 2 sets of games on both the OTS and adapted versions of the Wii Fit Balance Board. Order of controller version played first was randomized. After participants played each version, we administered the System Usability Scale (SUS) to examine the participants’ perceived usability. Results: The adapted version of the Wii Fit Balance Board resulting from the user-centered design approach met the needs of a variety of users. The adapted controller (1) allowed manual wheelchair users to engage in game play, which was previously not possible; (2) included Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant handrails as part of the controller, enabling stable and safe game play; and (3) included a sensitivity control feature, allowing users to fine-tune the controller to match the users’ range of COB motion. More than half the sample could not use the OTS version of the Wii Fit Balance Board, while all participants were able to use the adapted version. All participants rated the adapted Wii Fit Balance Board at a minimum as “good,” while those who could not use the OTS Wii Fit Balance Board rated the adapted Wii Fit Balance Board as “excellent.” We found a significant negative correlation between lower-extremity function and differences between OTS and adapted SUS scores, indicating that as lower-extremity function decreased, participants perceived the adapted Wii Fit Balance Board as more usable. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a successful adaptation of a widely used AVG controller. The adapted controller’s potential to increase physical activity levels among people with mobility impairments will be evaluated in a subsequent trial.

Enhancing well-being has benefits in its own right and could be a good strategy for preventing depression. Providing well-being interventions via the Internet may have synergetic effects. Objective: Psyfit (&#8220;mental fitness online&#8221;) is a fully automated self-help intervention to improve well-being based on positive psychology. This study examines the clinical effects of this intervention. Methods: We conducted a 2-armed randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of access to Psyfit for 2 months (n=143) to a waiting-list control condition (n=141). Mild to moderately depressed adults in the general population seeking self-help were recruited. Primary outcome was well-being measured by Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) and WHO Well-being Index (WHO-5); secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety, vitality, and general health measured by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), and Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form (MOS-SF) vitality and general health subscales, respectively. Online measurements were taken at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months after baseline. Results: The dropout rate was 37.8% in the Psyfit group and 22.7% in the control group. At 2-month follow-up, Psyfit tended to be more effective in enhancing well-being (nonsignificantly for MHC-SF: Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.27,  P =.06; significantly for WHO-5: Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.31,  P =.01), compared to the waiting-list control group. For the secondary outcomes, small but significant effects were found for general health (Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.14,  P =.01), vitality ( d =0.22,  P =.02), anxiety symptoms (Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.32,  P =.001), and depressive symptoms (Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.36,  P =.02). At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant effects on well-being (MHC-SF: Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.01,  P =.90; WHO-5: Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.26,  P =.11), whereas depressive symptoms (Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.35,  P =.02) and anxiety symptoms (Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.35,  P =.001) were still significantly reduced compared to the control group. There was no clear dose&#8211;response relationship between adherence and effectiveness, although some significant differences appeared across most outcomes in favor of those completing at least 1 lesson in the intervention. Conclusions: This study shows that an online well-being intervention can effectively enhance well-being (at least in the short-term and for 1 well-being measure) and can help to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms. Further research should focus on increasing adherence and motivation, reaching and serving lower-educated people, and widening the target group to include people with different levels of depressive symptoms.

Based on a face-to-face intervention program, we adapted and designed a Web-based fully automated psychoeducational program (called Diapason) inspired by a cognitive approach. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate through a pilot unblinded randomized controlled trial the efficacy and acceptability of a Web-based psychoeducational program for informal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (PWAD) based on a mixed methods research design. Methods: We recruited and randomized offline 49 informal caregivers of a PWAD in a day care center in Paris, France. They either received the Web-based intervention and usual care for 3 months (experimental group, n=25) or only usual care (control group, n=24). Caregivers&#8217; perceived stress (PSS-14, primary outcome), self-efficacy, burden, perceived health status, and depression (secondary outcomes) were measured during 3 face-to-face on-site visits: at baseline, at the end of the program (month 3), and after follow-up (month 6). Additionally, semistructured interviews were conducted with experimental group caregivers at month 6 and examined with thematic analysis. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis did not show significant differences in self-perceived stress between the experimental and control groups ( P =.98). The experimental group significantly improved their knowledge of the illness ( d =.79,  P =.008) from baseline to month 3. Of the 25 participants allocated to the experimental group, 17 (71%) finished the protocol and entirely viewed at least 10 of 12 online sessions. On average, participants used the website 19.72 times (SD 12.88) and were connected for 262.20 minutes (SD 270.74). The results of the satisfaction questionnaire showed that most participants considered the program to be useful (95%, 19/20), clear (100%, 20/20), and comprehensive (85%, 17/20). Significant correlations were found between relationship and caregivers&#8217; program opinion ( P =.01). Thus, positive opinions were provided by husbands and sons (3/3), whereas qualified opinions were primarily reported by daughters (8/11). Female spouses expressed negative (2/3) or neutral opinions (1/3). Caregivers expected more dynamic content and further interaction with staff and peers. Conclusions: In this study, quantitative results were inconclusive owing to small sample size. Qualitative results indicated/showed little acceptance of the program and high expectations from caregivers. Caregivers did not rule out their interest in this kind of intervention provided that it met their needs. More dynamic, personalized, and social interventions are desirable. Our recruitment issues pointed out the necessity of in-depth studies about caregivers&#8217; help-seeking behaviors and readiness factors.

Thus, mobile health technology with or without low-intensity theory-based health counseling could become an important tool for promoting self-management. Objectives: The aim was to evaluate whether the introduction of technology-supported self-management using the Few Touch Application (FTA) diabetes diary with or without health counseling improved glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) levels, self-management, behavioral change, and health-related quality of life, and to describe the sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics of the participants after 4 months. Methods: A 3-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted in Norway during 2011-2013. In the 2 intervention groups, participants were given a mobile phone for 1 year, which provided access to the FTA diary, a self-help tool that recorded 5 elements: blood glucose, food habits, physical activity, personal goal setting, and a look-up system for diabetes information. One of the intervention groups was also offered theory-based health counseling with a specialist diabetes nurse by telephone for 4 months from baseline. Both intervention groups and the control group were provided usual care according to the national guidelines. Adults with type 2 diabetes and HbA 1c  &#8805;7.1% were included (N=151). There were 3 assessment points: baseline, 4 months, and 1 year. We report the short-term findings after 4 months. HbA 1c  was the primary outcome and the secondary outcomes were self-management (Health Education Impact Questionnaire, heiQ), behavioral change (diet and physical activity), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire). The data were analyzed using univariate methods (ANOVA), multivariate linear, and logistic regression. Results: Data were analyzed from 124 individuals (attrition rate was 18%). The groups were well balanced at baseline. There were no differences in HbA 1c  between groups after 4 months, but there was a decline in all groups. There were changes in self-management measured using the health service navigation item in the heiQ, with improvements in the FTA group compared to the control group ( P =.01) and in the FTA with health counseling group compared with both other groups ( P =.04). This may indicate an improvement in the ability of patients to communicate health needs to their health care providers. Furthermore, the FTA group reported higher scores for skill and technique acquisition at relieving symptoms compared to the control group ( P =.02). There were no significant changes in any of the domains of the SF-36. Conclusions: The primary outcome, HbA 1c , did not differ between groups after 4 months. Both of the intervention groups had significantly better scores than the control group for health service navigation and the FTA group also exhibited improved skill and technique acquisition.

The gaze-liking effect describes the tendency for people to rate objects as more likeable when they have recently seen a person repeatedly gaze toward rather than away from the object.

Our results indicate a much smaller standardised effect size (dz = 0.02) than that of the original study (dz = 0.94). Our smaller effect size was not due to general insensitivity to eye-gaze effects because the same sample showed a clear (dz = 1.09) gaze-cuing effect – faster reaction times when eyes looked toward vs away from target objects.

Given a set of initial seeds, greybox fuzzing continuously generates new test inputs to execute the program under test and gravitates executions towards rarely explored program regions with code coverage as feedback. Seed prioritization is an important step of greybox fuzzing that prioritizes promising seeds for input generation. However, mainstream greybox fuzzers like AFL++ and Zest tend to slight the importance of seed prioritization and plainly pick seeds according to the order of the seeds being queued, or rely on an approach with randomness, which may consequently degrade their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based seed prioritization approach named DiPri to facilitate greybox fuzzing. Specifically, DiPri calculates the distances among seeds and selects the ones that are farther from the others in priority to improve the probabilities of discovering previously unexplored regions. To make a preliminary evaluation, we integrate DiPri into AFL++ and Zest and conduct experiments on eight (four in C/C++ and four in Java) fuzz targets. We also consider six configurations, i.e., three prioritization modes multiplied by two distance measures, in our evaluation to investigate how different prioritization timings and measures affect DiPri. The experimental results show that, compared to the default seed prioritization approaches of AFL++ and Zest, DiPri covers 1.87%∼13.86% more edges in three out of four C/C++ fuzz targets and 0.29%∼4.97% more edges in the four Java fuzz targets with certain configurations. The results highlight the potential of facilitating greybox fuzzing with distance-based seed prioritization.",2023-07-17,2023-08-18 21:45:47,2023-08-18T21:45:47Z,2023-08-18 00:00:00,21–30,,,,,,DiPri,FUZZING 2023,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,Citation Key: qianDiPriDistanceBasedSeed2023,,,,,Greybox Fuzzing; Seed Distance; Seed Prioritization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still, programs implemented in rust can contain critical bugs. Apart from logic bugs and crashes, code in unsafe blocks can still trigger memory corruptions. To find these, the community uses traditional fuzzers like libfuzzer or aflpp, in combination with rust-specific macros. Of course, the fuzzers themselves are still written in memory-unsafe languages. In this paper, we explore the possibility of replacing the input generators with rust, while staying compatible to existing harnesses. Based on the rust fuzzer library libafl, we develop ourtool, a drop-in replacement for the C++ component of cargo-fuzz. We evaluate our tool, written in rust, against the original fuzzer libfuzzer. We show that we are not only able to successfully fuzz all three targets we tested with ourtool, but outperform cargo-fuzz in bug coverage. During our preliminary evaluation, we already manage to uncover new bugs in the pdf crate that could not be found by cargo-fuzz, proving the real-world applicability of our approach, and giving us high hopes for the planned follow-up evaluations.",2023-07-17,2023-08-18 21:45:44,2023-08-18T21:45:44Z,2023-08-18 00:00:00,39–46,,,,,,CrabSandwich,FUZZING 2023,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,Citation Key: crumpCrabSandwichFuzzingRust2023,,,,,framework; fuzzing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While studies have shown cross-cultural differences in levels of autism-related stigma, it remains unclear whether camouflaging and mental health difficulties vary across cultures. Hence, the current study had two aims: firstly, to determine whether significant relationships between autism acceptance, camouflaging, and mental health difficulties replicate in a more diverse cross-cultural sample of autistic adults and, secondly, to compare these variables across cultures. To fulfil these aims, 306 autistic adults from eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States) completed an online survey. Our results revealed that external acceptance and personal acceptance predicted lower levels of depression but not camouflaging or stress. Higher camouflaging predicted elevated levels of anxiety. Significant differences were found across countries in external acceptance, personal acceptance, depression, anxiety, and stress, even after controlling for relevant covariates. Specifically, autistic individuals in Japan experienced lower levels of external and personal acceptance, and those in Belgium experienced lower levels of external acceptance, than at least one other country. Unique profiles of mental health difficulties were identified across countries. Nevertheless, autistic individuals in South Africa consistently experienced the highest mental health burden, displaying elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, while those in the US experienced the lowest. Levels of camouflaging also differed across cultures, with those in Japan scoring lowest, however this became non-significant after controlling for covariates.

Previous research has identified cross-modal associations between musical features such as pitch, tempo, and visual features including height, and colour saturation/brightness. But while researchers have explored cross-cultural links between music and emotion as well as music and visual imagery, few studies have simultaneously investigated cross-cultural links between music, visual imagery, and emotion in order to distinguish the role of cultural experiences in contrast to innate perceptual capabilities. We hypothesize that cross-cultural emotion and cross-modal associations encompass both universality and diversity determined by innate perceptual capabilities and cultural experiences respectively and represented by: 1) cross-culturally consistent correlations between high level auditory features and low level visual features and dimensional emotions, 2) cross-cultural diversity in categorical emotional appraisal. In this study, we investigate the relationship between emotion and visual imagery induced by 6 musical excerpts in participants in Japan, Iran, and Canada through forced choice options such as matching excerpts with visual textures that vary in density, as well as dimensional and categorical emotion ratings for each excerpt manipulated in pitch and tempo. In our full manuscript, we will provide our power analysis and provide the details of our planned sample size.We will test the following four hypotheses: 1) tempo correlates with arousal levels cross-culturally, 2) tempo correlates with visual density cross-culturally, 3) emotion category ratings tend to vary between cultures and often even within cultures in response to slow tempo musical excerpts, and 4) emotion ratings show more consistency cross-culturally in response to faster tempo pieces.Each of the hypotheses helps us conclude which cross-modal and emotion associations are 1) cross-culturally consistent, or 2) culturally-dependent. If we find cross-cultural consistency across all three groups, it would suggest physiological link/embodied cognition represented in cross-modal associations. If we find consistency in two cultures only or none at all, it would suggest that cross-modal associations are culturally dependent.

In two experiments, participants studied words in small and large size, rated JOLs, and completed a font-size test in which they indicated the font size at study and a standard old/new recognition test. The results confirmed that font size affected both JOLs and confidence ratings. The presentation of the counter-belief that memory is better for words in small font size in Experiment 2 and the analyses of confidence for participants who did not believe that large fonts improved memory suggested that the effect of font size on confidence was based on beliefs.

We show that forgetting involves losses in memory accessibility with no changes in memory precision. When participants learned a set of related word–location associations that conformed to a general pattern, we saw a strong trade-off; accessibility was enhanced, whereas precision was reduced.

However, research investigating this topic has studied a limited set of sacrificial dilemmas and did not test to what extent these effects might be moderated by specific features of the situation described in the sacrificial dilemma (for instance, whether the dilemma involves mortal or non-mortal harm).

The consequences are debilitating and place a great burden on patients, caregivers, and the health care system. Although inpatient rehabilitation programs have proven effective, the best practices for community-based rehabilitation required to maintain the gains in function and mobility post hospital discharge are currently unknown. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation post hospital discharge interventions for older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) following a hip fracture, and to identify the physical recovery outcomes and measures used in previous studies. Methods: The methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention were followed and findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search strategy included a combination of text words and subject headings relating to the concepts of CI, dementia, delirium, cognitive reserve, and hip fractures. For a study to be included in the review, it had to involve participants with CI who underwent hip fracture surgery, and consisted of an outpatient intervention that occurred in the participant&#8217;s home or community. Peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching various databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts to determine which articles comprising of a rehabilitation intervention within a community setting prior to being included for a full article review. A data extraction form and an evidence and quality checklist were used during the full article data analysis and synthesis. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity of measures and outcomes. Results: The original search resulted in over 3000 articles. Of those, three studies satisfied the necessary criteria to be included in the systematic review. All studies included inpatient and outpatient physiotherapy, with some including a cognitive component, family education, and a discharge assessment. Conclusions: The findings from this review suggest that community-based rehabilitation post hospital discharge interventions show promising results towards improving various physical function outcomes, mobility, and activities of daily living for older adults with CI following a hip fracture.

A pre-registered replication study,Frontiers in Psychology,,1664-1078,10/f6h4cc,,"WHEN ENCOUNTERING AN UNKNOWN INDIVIDUAL, SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO AUTOMATICALLY PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF THREE FUNDAMENTAL DIMENSIONS: People seem to mandatorily encode race, sex and age. In contradiction to this general finding, Kurzban et al. (2001) showed that race encoding is not automatic and inevitable, but rather a byproduct of categorization in terms of coalitions. In particular, they argue and empirically support that when other coalitional information is present, the encoding of race is spectacularly reduced. In the present contribution, we present a replication of the race-erased effect reported by Kurzban et al. First, we give a detailed overview of the hypotheses, the experimental methodology, the derivation of the sample size required to achieve a power of 95%, and the criteria that need to be met for a successful replication. Then we present the findings of an empirical test that met the requirements of our power analyses. Our results indicate that the encoding of race is indeed reduced when another coalitional cue is available, yet this reduction is less marked than in the original study.

Two accounts have been proposed to explain this relationship, one of which emphasizes proximally avoiding outgroups, and the other of which emphasizes adherence to traditional norms. According to the former, immigrants are perceived as being more infectious because they carry novel pathogens due to their foreign ecological origins. According to the latter, immigrants' foreign norms are perceived as posing a pathogen threat. This study aimed to disentangle these accounts. Participants (N = 975) were randomly assigned to read a description of an immigrant who had high or low contact with locals and high or low assimilation to local norms. The effect of disgust sensitivity on sentiments toward the immigrant (and immigrants like him) was compared across conditions. Results supported the traditional norms account: disgust sensitivity related to anti-immigrant sentiments when the immigrant was described as not assimilating to local norms, but not when he was described as assimilating. Contrary to the outgroup avoidance account, the relationship between disgust sensitivity and anti-immigrant sentiments did not vary across the high-contact and low-contact conditions. Results suggest that resistance to foreign norms, rather than avoidance of novel pathogens, better explains the relationship between pathogen avoidance and outgroup prejudice.",2019-09-01,2019-10-31 20:40:56,2019-10-31T20:40:56Z,2019-10-02 14:49:58,103817,,,84,,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,00002,,,,,Disgust sensitivity; Immigration; Outgroup avoidance; The behavioral immune system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A registered report,Judgment and Decision Making,,,,http://journal.sjdm.org/18/18510/jdm18510.pdf,"Executing an important decision can be as easy as moving a mouse cursor or reaching towards the preferred option with a hand. But would we decide differently if choosing required walking a few steps towards an option? More generally, is our preference invariant to the means and motor costs of reporting it? Previous research demonstrated that asymmetric motor costs can nudge the decision-maker towards a less costly option. However, virtually all traditional decision-making theories predict that increasing motor costs symmetrically for all options should not affect choice in any way. This prediction is disputed by the theory of embodied cognition, which suggests that motor behavior is an integral part of cognitive processes, and that motor costs can affect our choices. In this registered report, we investigated whether varying motor costs can affect response dynamics and the final choices in an intertemporal choice task: choosing between a readily available small reward and a larger but delayed reward. Our study compared choices reported by moving a computer mouse cursor towards the preferred option with the choices executed via a more motor costly walking procedure. First, we investigated whether relative values of the intertemporal choice options affect walking trajectories in the same way as they affect mouse cursor dynamics. Second, we tested a hypothesis that, in the walking condition, increased motor costs of a preference reversal would decrease the number of changes-of-mind and therefore increase the proportion of impulsive, smaller-but-sooner choices. We confirmed the hypothesis that walking trajectories reflect covert dynamics of decision making, and rejected the hypothesis that increased motor costs of responding affect decisions in an intertemporal choice task. Overall, this study contributes to the empirical basis enabling the decision-making theories to address the complex interplay between cognitive and motor processes.",2019-07,2019-10-31 20:40:18,2019-10-31T20:40:18Z,,455-469,,4,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00000,,,,⛔ No DOI found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a review of evidence found that improved road / street lighting was associated with reductions in crime, these reductions occurred in daylight as well as after dark, suggesting any effect was not due only to changes in visual conditions. One limitation of previous studies is that crime data are reported in aggregate and thus previous analyses were required to make simplifications concerning types of crimes or locations. We will overcome that by working with a UK police force to access records of individual crimes. We will use these data to determine whether the risk of crime at a specific time of day is greater after dark than during daylight. If no difference is found, this would suggest improvements to visual conditions after dark through lighting would have no effect. If however the risk of crime occurring after dark was greater than during daylight, quantifying this effect would provide a measure to assess the potential effectiveness of lighting in reducing crime risk after dark. We will use a case and control approach to analyse ten years of crime data. We will compare counts of crimes in ‘case’ hours, that are in daylight and darkness at different times of the year, and ‘control’ hours, that are in daylight throughout the year. From these counts we will calculate odds ratios as a measure of the effect of darkness on risk of crime, using these to answer three questions: 1) Is the risk of overall crime occurring greater after dark than during daylight? 2) Does the risk of crime occurring after dark vary depending on the category of crime? 3) Does the risk of crime occurring after dark vary depending on the geographical area?",2024-01-19,2024-04-06 02:29:40,2024-04-06T02:29:40Z,2024-04-05 14:46:09,e0291971,,1,19,,PLOS ONE,Does darkness increase the risk of certain types of crime?,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Uttley-2024,,,,,Crime; Daylight; Medical risk factors; Police; Roads; Theft; Twilight; Violent crime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past two decades, interest in the influence of tDCS on behaviour has increased markedly, resulting in a large body of literature spanning multiple domains. However, the effect of tDCS on human performance often varies, bringing into question the reliability of this approach. While reviews and meta-analyses highlight the contributions of methodological inconsistencies and individual differences, no published studies have directly tested the intra-individual reliability of tDCS effects on behaviour. Here, we conducted a large scale, double-blinded, sham-controlled registered report to assess the reliability of two single-session low-dose tDCS montages, previously found to impact response selection and motor learning operations, across two separate time periods. Our planned analysis found no evidence for either protocol being effective nor reliable. Post-hoc explorative analyses found evidence that tDCS influenced motor learning, but not response selection learning. In addition, the reliability of motor learning performance across trials was shown to be disrupted by tDCS. These findings are amongst the first to shed light specifically on the intra-individual reliability of tDCS effects on behaviour and provide valuable information to the field.",2024-04-01,2024-04-06 02:29:36,2024-04-06T02:29:36Z,2024-04-05 16:13:17,61-79,,,173,,Cortex,Exploring the intra-individual reliability of tDCS,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,Citation Key: Willmot-2024,,,,,Behaviour; Intra-individual; Motor-learning; Reliability; Response-learning; tDCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, those benefits of person-first language may not apply to all social groups equally. The present study examines a boundary condition of the effects of person-first language. Specifically, we postulate that person-first language reduces the stigmatization of outgroups to a lesser degree if individuals hold more important negative attitudes towards the respective communities. We will test this hypothesis in a two-factorial 2 (target group) x 2 (descriptor) online experiment that includes a control group and for which we will recruit a general-population sample (N = 681). Stereotyping, dehumanization, as well as negative affect and behavioral intentions towards two outgroups will be compared: people with a physical disability/the physically disabled (i.e., negative attitudes are expected to be less important) and people who have committed a violent crime/violent criminals (i.e., negative attitudes are expected to be more important). Our findings will bear implications for understanding when language use could influence public opinion of different social groups.

As there is reciprocal communication between circulating epinephrine and the LC, plasma epinephrine is used as the index of LC-NE activity. The aim of this crossover randomized controlled trial is to expand on previous findings by investigating the effects of free-weight, multiple-joint, and structural barbell resistance exercises. Previous studies have had some methodological limitations, such as failure to report the process of randomization, absence of resistance exercise familiarization before the maximal strength testing, and lack of protocol publication. To address these issues, this study incorporates resistance exercise familiarization, transparent reporting of randomization, and submission as a registered report. The results suggest that a single session of resistance exercise (barbell squat, press, and deadlift) with an intensity of 65%-78% 1RM for five repetitions (70%-90% relative intensity) and three sets with 3-min rest intervals improved Stroop congruent reaction time (RT) only (t(27) = -2.663, mean reduction = -15 ms, p = .013, 95% CI [-26, -3]).

In addition, multiple studies have shown a dependence on a stimulus’ angular position relative to the fovea. In humans, the resulting spatial profile of perceptual performance (the “performance field”) typically shows better performance near the lower vertical meridian, compared to the upper vertical meridian, and better performance near the horizontal meridian compared to the vertical meridian. Predominantly, these variations have been interpreted as sensory inhomogeneities. But it has also been shown that they are modulated by the allocation of spatial attention, either homogeneously elevating performance or compensating for the sensory inhomogeneities. Here, we propose a study protocol for pre-registration to investigate such interactions between sensory and attentional effects. First, we will determine performance fields for time-dependent, dynamic stimuli, namely the direction discrimination of moving random dot patterns. Then, we will establish whether directing focal attention to a particular stimulus location differentially improves thresholds compared to a distributed attention condition.",2023-11-30,2024-01-13 07:59:56,2024-01-13T07:59:56Z,2024-01-12 15:13:34,e0289411,,11,18,,PLOS ONE,Effect of attention on human direction-discrimination thresholds at iso-eccentric locations in the visual field,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Saxena-2023,,,,,Attention; Fovea centralis; Human performance; Luminance; Psychophysics; Sensory cues; Sensory perception; Vision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A registered report on appearance-versus health-based message framing in exercise appeals targeted towards women,Psychology of Sport and Exercise,,1469-0292,10.1016/j.psychsport.2023.102555,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029223001796,"Objective Prospect theory proposes that message framing differentially impacts the likelihood of engaging in health-related behaviors. Specifically, gain-framed messages that highlight the benefits of engaging in a behavior are more effective at promoting preventative behaviors than loss-framed messages highlighting the costs associated with a lack of engagement. Research suggests that gain-framed messages may more successfully reduce psychological reactance compared to loss-framed messages, which in turn, may promote behavioral change. However, reactance as a mechanism has been largely overlooked in the literature and support for this hypothesis is mixed. These conflicting results may be due to additional factors, such as outcomes of the targeted behavior (health vs. appearance) and goal orientation. Therefore, the present study examined whether message framing (gain-vs. loss-framing) and the fit between a health message’s outcomes of focus (i.e., health vs. appearance) and an individual’s goal orientation predict psychological reactance, and in turn, cognitive and behavioral outcomes related to exercise. Design This study employed a randomized trial with four experimental groups composed of insufficiently active women. Specifically, participants were randomized to view a loss- or gain-framed video emphasizing either health- or appearance-related outcomes. Results Counter to expectations, there were no between-group differences on exercise-related attitudes and intentions immediately post-intervention, or self-reported behavior at one-week post intervention. However, when health outcomes were emphasized, loss-framed messages generally elicited more reactivity than gain-framed messages. This finding was not replicated for the appearance conditions. Appearance messages also generally elicited more reactance than health messages. Meanwhile, reactance did not predict changes in exercise-related attitudes, intentions, or self-reported behavior, and the relationship between messaging content and reactance was generally not moderated by goal orientation. Conclusion For young inactive women, receiving messages geared towards appearance-related risks of inactivity (e.g., weight gain) tended to produce more reactivity than messages geared towards health-related risks of inactivity (e.g., weakened immune system). However, this did not change exercise-related attitudes, intentions, or self-reported behaviors. Health gain-framed education regarding exercise may be an important part of a comprehensive intervention toolkit, but is likely not enough in and of itself to support or hinder exercise engagement, regardless of framing or emphasized outcomes.",2023-10-29,2023-11-11 02:46:28,2023-11-11T02:46:28Z,2023-11-10 15:50:02,102555,,,,,Psychology of Sport and Exercise,Does messaging matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,Citation Key: More-2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A crucial point is how stimulation parameters may affect TEPs, as they may contribute to the general variability of findings across studies. Here, we manipulated two TMS parameters (i.e. current direction and pulse waveform) while measuring (a) an early TEP component reflecting contralateral inhibition of motor areas, namely, M1-P15, as an operative model of interhemispheric cortico-cortical connectivity, and (b) motor-evoked potentials (MEP) for the corticospinal pathway. Our results showed that these two TMS parameters are crucial to evoke the M1-P15, influencing its amplitude, latency, and replicability. Specifically, (a) M1-P15 amplitude was strongly affected by current direction in monophasic stimulation; (b) M1-P15 latency was significantly modulated by current direction for monophasic and biphasic pulses. The replicability of M1-P15 was substantial for the same stimulation condition. At the same time, it was poor when stimulation parameters were changed, suggesting that these factors must be controlled to obtain stable single-subject measures. Finally, MEP latency was modulated by current direction, whereas non-statistically significant changes were evident for amplitude. Overall, our study highlights the importance of TMS parameters for early TEP responses recording and suggests controlling their impact in developing connectivity biomarkers from TEPs. Moreover, these results point out that the excitability of the corticospinal tract, which is commonly used as a reference to set TMS intensity, may not correspond to the excitability of cortico-cortical pathways.",1970-01-01,2023-09-09 05:20:59,2023-09-09T05:20:59Z,2023-09-08 15:07:40,,,n/a,n/a,,,Effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) current direction and pulse waveform on cortico-cortical connectivity,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ejn.16127 Citation Key: guidaliEffectsTranscranialMagnetic,,,,,TMS-EEG; TMS-evoked potentials; cortico-cortical connectivity; corticospinal connectivity; electroencephalography; motor cortex; transcranial magnetic stimulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, diabetes is one of the major therapeutic concerns globally. Moreover, Iran is among the countries with the highest incidence of diabetic patients. Furthermore, library-based studies by researchers have shown that thus far no study has been carried out to evaluate the relationship between Web-based diabetic personal health records (DPHR) and self-care indicators in Iran. Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of Web-based DPHR on self-care status of diabetic patients in an intervention group as compared with a control group. Methods: The effect of DPHR on self-care was assessed by using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol for a 2-arm parallel group with a 1:1 allocation ratio. During a 4-month trial period, the control group benefited from the routine care; the intervention group additionally had access to the Web-based DPHR app besides routine care. During the trial, 2 time points at baseline and postintervention were used to evaluate the impact of the DPHR app. A sample size of 72 people was randomly and equally assigned to both the control and intervention groups. The primary outcome measure was the self-care status of the participants. Results: Test results showed that the self-care status in the intervention group in comparison with the control group had a significant difference. In addition, the dimensions of self-care, including normal values, changes trend, the last measured value, and the last time measured values had a significant difference while other dimensions had no significant difference. Furthermore, we found no correlation between Web-based DPHR system and covariates, including scores of weight, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum creatinine, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, and planned visit adherence, as well as the change trend of mean for blood glucose and blood pressure. Conclusions: We found that as a result of the Web-based DPHR app, the self-care scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. In total, we found no correlation between the Web-based DPHR app and covariates, including planned visit adherence, HbA1c, serum creatinine, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, weight, and the change trend of mean for blood glucose and blood pressure.

Using a mathematical model to disentangle sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms and general preference for inaction versus action, analyses further revealed that testosterone administration influenced judgements by increasing sensitivity to moral norms. Exploratory analyses suggested the opposite pattern for endogenous testosterone measured at baseline, in that higher levels of endogenous testosterone were associated with lower sensitivity to moral norms.

Researchers often cited this finding as evidence for the idea that detecting a piece of blatant misinformation is similar to being given a warning. However, to our knowledge, the inoculation effect has not been replicated. Methods Experiment 1 was a direct replication. Participants either encountered four pieces of nonblatant misinformation (subtle condition) or the same four pieces of nonblatant misinformation and an additional piece of blatant misinformation (blatant condition). Experiment 2 was a conceptual replication in which we also manipulated the presence or absence of initial testing.

Research suggests that communicating information about changing ‘dynamic’ norms may be a useful tool for changing attitudes and behaviours in the direction of those currently held by the minority. This study utilizes a 2 x 2 mixed design (Norm Type [dynamic/static] x Visual Cue [present/absent], and a no-task control), and a follow-up assessment after one week to investigate the effect of making dynamic norms salient on various meat consumption outcomes: attitudes towards meat consumption, interest in reducing one’s own meat consumption, intentions to reduce one’s own meat consumption, and self-reported meat consumption. We used an online sample of British participants (N = 1294), ranging in ages 18–77 (Mage = 39.97, SDage = 13.71; 55.8% female). We hypothesized that: (a) dynamic norms will positively influence meat consumption outcomes, (b) visual cues will accentuate the difference between norm conditions, (c) using a visual cue will enhance the effect of dynamic norms, and (d) any effects of dynamic norms will endure over a period of one week. We found no positive effect of dynamic norms (vs. static norms) on any outcome at time 1, and no positive effect on changes in outcomes from time 1 to time 2. However, we found a positive interaction of norm type and visual cue at time 1 (although not from time 1 to time 2): the addition of a visual cue to dynamic norm messages enhanced the positive effect of the message at time 1 (but did not enhance the changes occurring from time 1 to time 2). Analyses for changes in self-reported meat consumption did not reach our evidential threshold.

The use of automated driving systems (ADSs) in the real world requires rigorous testing to ensure safety. To increase trust, ADSs should be tested on a large set of diverse road scenarios. Literature suggests that if a vehicle is driven along a set of geometrically diverse roads-measured using various diversity measures (DMs)-it will react in a wide range of behaviours, thereby increasing the chances of observing failures (if any), or strengthening the confidence in its safety, if no failures are observed. To the best of our knowledge, however, this assumption has never been tested before, nor have road DMs been assessed for their properties. Objective/Aim. Our goal is to perform an exploratory study on 47 currently used and new, potentially promising road DMs. Specifically, our research questions look into the road DMs themselves, to analyse their properties (e.g. monotonicity, computation efficiency), and to test correlation between DMs. Furthermore, we look at the use of road DMs to investigate whether the assumption that diverse test suites of roads expose diverse driving behaviour holds. Method. Our empirical analysis relies on a state-of-the-art, open-source ADSs testing infrastructure and uses a data set containing over 97,000 individual road geometries and matching simulation data that were collected using two driving agents.

This registered report assessed design characteristics of registered clinical trials for COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 trials to empirically explore the design of clinical research during a pandemic and how it compares to research conducted in non-pandemic times. We did a retrospective cohort study with a 1 : 1 ratio of interventional COVID-19 registrations to non-COVID-19 registrations, with four trial design outcomes: use of control arm, randomization, blinding and prospective registration. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of investigating COVID-19 versus not COVID-19 and estimate direct and total effects of investigating COVID-19 for each outcome. The primary analysis showed a positive direct and total effect of COVID-19 on the use of control arms and randomization. It showed a negative direct effect of COVID-19 on blinding but no evidence of a total effect. There was no evidence of an effect on prospective registration. Taken together with secondary and sensitivity analyses, our findings are inconclusive but point towards a higher prevalence of key design characteristics in COVID-19 trials versus controls. The findings do not support much existing COVID-19 research quality literature, which generally suggests that COVID-19 led to a reduction in quality.

It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We administered two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We then subjected the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to examine which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. Results show that none of the pre-registered models fit the data well, an ambiguous result that leaves unanswered the question of whether intelligence and divergent thinking tests measure the same construct. Exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) measurement models of each test separately shows that the TTCT-F may not measure a coherent, unitary construct—leading to model misspecification when TTCT-F subtests were included in larger models.

Res.,,,10.1287/opre.1080.0665,,"This work investigates the properties of a linear family of scoring rules that are intended specifically for quantile assessment (including the assessment of multiple quantiles) and can be related to a realistic decision-making problem. Quantile assessments are commonly encountered in the elicitation of probability distributions in decision analysis, forecasting, and risk analysis. Scoring rules have been developed to provide ex ante incentives for careful and truthful assessments and ex post evaluation measures in the context of probability assessment. We show that these scoring rules designed for probability assessment provide inappropriate incentives if used for quantile assessment. We investigate the properties of a linear family of scoring rules that are intended specifically for quantile assessment (including the assessment of multiple quantiles) and can be related to a realistic decision-making problem. These rules provide proper incentives for quantile assessment and yield higher expected scores for distributions that are more informative in the sense of having less dispersion. We discuss the special case of interval forecasts and a generalization involving transformations, and we briefly mention other possible extensions.",2009,2022-06-06 23:53:21,2022-06-06T23:53:21Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Semantic Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effortful thinking has been shown to help reduce anchoring effects, in which people form social judgments by adjusting from an initial value (the anchor). We therefore predicted that ego depletion would reduce the amount of adjustment from an initial anchor, leaving the final judgment relatively close to the anchor value. In contrast to previous research by Banker et al. (2017), we excluded alternative explanations, such as social mechanisms. In particular, we tested adjustment from internally generated and externally provided anchors. We theorized that judgment adjustment processes are the same for both internal and external cues. The results showed that neither self-generated nor experimenter-provided anchors were affected by ego depletion, thus leaving social mechanisms as the prime alternative explanation. The data also showed that susceptibility to anchoring is not a trait because reactions to different anchors were not substantially intercorrelated. Further, providing externally or internally generated anchors did not make a fundamental difference. However, the loss of data was higher with self-generated anchors. Overall, the results suggest that researchers can confidently rely on experimenter-generated anchors.",2020-03-01,2020-06-02 11:49:20,2020-06-02T11:49:20Z,2020-05-06 13:18:10,103942,,,87,,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,00000  Stage 1: https://osf.io/97gaf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An fMRI adaptation study,Cortex,,0010-9452,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.07.017,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945219302850,"A key question in the field of numerical cognition is how the human brain represents numerical symbols (e.g., Arabic digits). A large body of research has implicated left parietal regions in symbolic number processing. One possible explanation for this lateralization of neural activity is the handedness of participants. Specifically, participants in neuroimaging research are almost exclusively right-handed. The current study sought to probe whether number representation in the brain is associated with hand preference for handwriting. To address this question, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation of a group of right-handed participants with a group of left-handed participants during the passive viewing of symbolic numbers. At the whole-brain level, the right-handers demonstrated a previously obtained left-lateralized effect within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The left-handers showed some evidence of reverse lateralization of this effect in the IPS. However, when the groups were statistically compared, we found no regions that demonstrated group-level differences. In a follow-up region of interest (ROI) analysis within the left and right parietal lobes, we calculated laterality indices for each participant. Results did not provide support for group differences in laterality within the right or left IPS ROI. These findings do not support the hypothesis that handwriting plays a role in the lateralization of symbolic number processing in the brain. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that lead to left-lateralization for symbolic number processing.",2019-12-01,2019-12-10 08:35:23,2019-12-10T08:35:23Z,2019-12-06 14:46:04,27-43,,,121,,Cortex,Does writing handedness affect neural representation of symbolic number?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,00000,,,,,Handedness; Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); Number representation; Number symbols; fMRI adaptation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many countries, it is common to see spontaneous roadside memorials constructed in response to road fatalities. These memorials are controversial and are explicitly banned in many jurisdictions. Advocates argue that the presence of memorials improves safety by making other drivers aware of an especially dangerous road where others have died, whereas opponents argue that they are distracting and decrease safety by diverting drivers’ attention away from the road. However, there has been almost no research examining the effects of roadside memorials on road user behavior and safety. In this study, 40 drivers viewed videos of road scenes with and without memorials, to examine how the presence of roadside memorials influences drivers’ attentional allocation (indicated by eye movements to the roadside area) and safety-related behaviors (indicated by perceived risk ratings and preferred travel speeds for the road). The findings indicate memorials do capture visual attention, as participants were more likely to fixate on memorials compared with a comparison object placed on the roadside. However, fixations on the memorials, and to the roadside area in general, were relatively brief. The presence of memorials did not affect perceived risk and did not produce a clear systematic effect on preferred travel speed. Nearly all drivers in our study supported permitting roadside memorials, but a small number strongly opposed memorials on the belief they are distracting and/or distressing.Preregistration detailsThis study was preregistered with Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications and received in-principle acceptance on 4 March 2018.

Scholars have long argued for the use of local normative criteria to increase the diversity of students identified for gifted services, and although some districts across the country have applied such recommendations, little research has been carried out.

Two psychological approaches to the study of SES say they are, but emphasize different reasons. The rank approach argues that because individuals with lower SES experience low rank, they feel less in control and more threatened by others, so it is more valuable for them to understand others' mental states. The cultural approach argues that because lower SES cultures foster more interdependent values, people steeped in those cultures focus more on others, leading them to better understand others' mental states. Previous tests of the basic hypothesis these two approaches share have yielded mixed evidence. This registered report uses a large-scale, nationally representative sample to accomplish two goals. First, it tests the basic shared hypothesis, finding that lower subjective rank, social class cultural group, and income—but not education—all predict better empathic accuracy. Second, it explores additional research questions, finding that subjective rank more strongly predicts empathic accuracy compared to SES cultural group (consistent with the rank approach), but childhood SES more strongly predicts empathic accuracy than adulthood SES (consistent with the cultural approach).

However, it is unclear whether the effect is driven by automatic entrainment to rhythm or non-rhythmic temporal prediction. This registered report presents an Electroencephalographic (EEG) study aimed at establishing the cognitive and neural mechanisms of the effect of temporal prediction on recognition. In a blocked design, stimulus onset during encoding was systematically manipulated in four conditions prior to recognition testing: rhythmic fixed (RF), rhythmic variable (RV), arrhythmic fixed (AF), and arrhythmic variable (AV). By orthogonally varying rhythm and temporal position we were able to assess their independent contributions to recognition enhancement. Our behavioural results did not replicate previous findings that show a difference in recognition memory based on temporal predictability at encoding. However, event-related potential (ERP) component analysis did show an early (N1) interaction effect of temporal position and rhythm, and later (N2 and Dm) effects driven by temporal position only. Taken together, we observed effects of temporal prediction at encoding, but these differences did not translate to later effects of memory, suggesting that effects of temporal prediction on recognition are less robust than previously thought.",2023-12-01,2023-11-10 15:38:41,2023-11-10T15:38:41Z,2023-11-10 15:37:59,130-145,,,169,,Cortex,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,Citation Key: Jones-2023,,,,,EEG; Prediction; Recognition memory; Rhythm; Temporal expectation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We verified whether recognizing discrepancies between personal memories and externally suggested information, along with certain individual differences, moderates the memory distrust-suggestibility link. Methods Experiment 1 (N = 306) followed a classic three-step procedure with a discrepancy awareness test. In Experiment 2 (N = 316) a computerized version of the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale with a discrepancy awareness test was utilized. Both experiments manipulated the state of memory distrust and assessed participants' trait memory distrust, compliance, anxiety and self-esteem. Results While the effect of memory deterioration due to misinformation and suggestions was replicated, the hypotheses regarding the relationship between memory distrust and suggestibility were not confirmed. However, for interrogative suggestibility, individuals induced to doubt their own memory were more susceptible to suggestions when recognizing inconsistencies between the story and suggestive questions. Conclusions From the theoretical side, the concept of memory distrust appears to be useful to explain the reasons for succumbing to suggestions. However, our findings indicate that memory distrust toward committing omission errors and the experimentally induced state appear unrelated (misinformation effect paradigm) or marginally related (memory distrust state and interrogative suggestibility) to the tendency to yield to suggestions. This prompts further research using a different operationalisation of this construct.",,2023-11-10 15:32:03,2023-11-10T15:32:03Z,2023-11-10 15:31:21,,,n/a,n/a,,,Memory distrust and suggestibility,,,,,,,en,© 2023 British Psychological Society.,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/lcrp.12249 Citation Key: Dudek-,,,,,discrepancy detection; interrogative suggestibility; memory distrust; misinformation effect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its flexibility, automated nature, and effectiveness render it an indispensable tool for making software more secure. A key feature that enables its impressive performance is coverage feedback, which guides the fuzzer to explore different parts of the program. The most prominent way to use this feedback is novelty search, in which the fuzzer generates new inputs and only keeps those that have exercised a new program edge. This is grounded in the assumption that novel coverage is a proxy for interestingness. Bolstered by its widespread success, it is easy to overlook its limitations. Particularly the phenomenon of input shadowing, situations in which an “interesting” input is discarded because it does not contribute novel coverage, needs to be considered. This phenomenon limits the explorable input space and risks missing bugs when shadowed inputs are more amenable to mutations that would trigger bugs. In this work, we analyze input shadowing in more detail and find that multiple fuzzing runs of the same target exhibit a different basic block hit frequency despite overlapping code coverage. In other words, different fuzzing runs may find the same set of basic blocks but one might exercise specific basic blocks significantly more often than the other, and vice versa. To better distribute the frequency, we propose restarting the fuzzer to reset the fuzzing state, diversifying the fuzzer’s attention across basic blocks. Our preliminary evaluation of three Fuzzbench targets finds that fuzzer restarts effectively distribute the basic block hit frequencies and boost the achieved coverage by up to 9.3%.",2023-07-17,2023-08-18 21:45:49,2023-08-18T21:45:49Z,2023-08-18 00:00:00,12–20,,,,,,Novelty Not Found,FUZZING 2023,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,Citation Key: schillerNoveltyNotFound2023,,,,,Fuzzing; Software Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we introduced an interactive tool called InFuzz to help humans better understand and intervene in the fuzzing process through visual bottleneck analysis. InFuzz extracts information from source code and runtime coverage and maps blocking branches in tests to source code lines, and gets potential inputs to blocking branches through dynamic data flow analysis, which are presented in the form of HTML web pages to the tester. In addition, it provides code annotation techniques to better intervene in fuzzing.

This contributes to clinical inertia and poor glycemic control. Effectiveness of traditional continuing medical education (CME) to solve that is limited, so new approaches are required. Electronic games are a good option, as they can be very effective and easily disseminated. Objective: The objective of our study was to assess applicability, user acceptance, and educational effectiveness of InsuOnline, an electronic serious game for medical education on insulin therapy for DM, compared with a traditional CME activity. Methods: Primary care physicians (PCPs) from South of Brazil were invited by phone or email to participate in an unblinded randomized controlled trial and randomly allocated to play the game InsuOnline, installed as an app in their own computers, at the time of their choice, with minimal or no external guidance, or to participate in a traditional CME session, composed by onsite lectures and cases discussion. Both interventions had the same content and duration (~4 h). Applicability was assessed by the number of subjects who completed the assigned intervention in each group. Insulin-prescribing competence (factual knowledge, problem-solving skills, and attitudes) was self-assessed through a questionnaire applied before, immediately after, and 3 months after the interventions. Acceptance of the intervention (satisfaction and perceived importance for clinical practice) was also assessed immediately after and 3 months after the interventions, respectively. Results: Subjects’ characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 38, 51.4% [69/134] male). In the game group, 69 of 88 (78%) completed the intervention, compared with 65 of 73 (89%) in the control group, with no difference in applicability. Percentage of right answers in the competence subscale, which was 52% at the baseline in both groups, significantly improved immediately after both interventions to 92% in the game group and to 85% in control (P<.001). After 3 months, it remained significantly higher than that at the baseline in both groups (80% in game, and 76% in control; P<.001). Absolute increase in competence score was better with the game (40%) than with traditional CME (34%; P=.01). Insulin-related attitudes were improved both after the game (significant improvement in 4 of 9 items) and after control activity (3 of 9). Both interventions were very well accepted, with most subjects rating them as “fun or pleasant,” “useful,” and “practice-changing.” Conclusions: The game InsuOnline was applicable, very well accepted, and highly effective for medical education on insulin therapy. In view of its flexibility and easy dissemination, it is a valid option for large-scale CME, potentially helping to reduce clinical inertia and to improve quality of care for DM patients.

Comorbid exercise dependence (ExD) is common in AN and associated with significantly worse symptom severity and treatment outcomes. Research points to cognitive inflexibility as a prominent executive function inefficiency and transdiagnostic etiologic and maintaining mechanism linking AN and ExD. This study will evaluate the initial efficacy of adjunctive Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT), which has been shown to produce cognitive improvements in adults with AN, in targeting cognitive inflexibility in individuals with comorbid AN and ExD. As an exploratory aim, this study also addresses the current lack of quick and cost-effective assessments of cognitive flexibility by establishing the utility of two proposed biomarkers, heart rate variability and salivary oxytocin. Method We will conduct a single-group, within-subjects trial of an established CRT protocol delivered remotely as an adjunct to inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment as usual (TAU) to adult patients (n = 42) with comorbid AN and ExD. Assessments, including self-report, neuropsychological, and biomarker measurements, will occur at three time points. Results We expect CRT to increase cognitive flexibility transdiagnostically and consequently, along with TAU, positively impact AN and ExD compulsivity and symptom severity, including weight gain. Discussion Findings will inform the development of more effective integrative interventions for AN and ExD targeting shared mechanisms and facilitate the routine assessment of cognitive flexibility as a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor across psychopathologies in clinical and research settings. Public Significance Patients with anorexia nervosa often engage in excessive exercise, leading to harmful outcomes, including increased suicidal behavior. This study examines the preliminary efficacy of an intervention that fosters flexible and holistic thinking in patients with problematic eating and exercise to, along with routine treatment, decrease harmful exercise symptoms. This study also examines new biological markers of the inflexible thinking style thought to be characteristic of anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence.",1970-01-01,2023-06-13 13:42:36,2023-06-13T13:42:36Z,2023-04-14 17:04:07,,,n/a,n/a,,,Impact of virtual adjunctive cognitive remediation therapy on cognitive flexibility and treatment outcomes in comorbid anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence as quantified using novel biomarkers,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23942,,,,life science,anorexia nervosa; cognitive flexibility; cognitive remediation therapy; exercise dependence; heart rate variability; oxytocin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the cost of switching languages, relative to staying in the same language, is similar across the two languages. The second effect is more uniquely connected to voluntary language switching, namely a benefit when performing in mixed language blocks relative to single language blocks, which has been connected to proactive language control. While the bidialectals in this study also showed symmetrical switch costs, no mixing effect was observed.

(2003), which found that individuals high in worry symptoms of anxiety show greater ERN amplitude than those low in worry. This research sparked a flurry of further investigations, with subsequent work proposing the ERN to be a putative neural marker for anxiety. However, almost two decades later, the robustness of the relationship between the ERN amplitude and anxiety has been called into question. As part of the #EEGManyLabs international collaborative (Pavlov et al., 2021), the proposed replication involves the collection of data from three highly-powered samples (n = 234 each) across nine collaborating sites in Germany, Norway, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, and the United States. Participants for the replication will be selected from a larger pool and assigned to the following three groups based on their scores on worry and phobia symptom scales: 1) high worry group, 2) high phobia/low worry group, and 3) low worry/phobia (control) group, with 70-80 participants in each group. All three groups of participants will complete a modified color-word Stroop task, consistent with procedures of Hajcak et al. (2003), while EEG recordings are made. As per Hajcak et al. (2003), we expect a significant main effect of group, with a larger overall ERN in the worry group than in the phobia and control groups, suggesting that enhanced sensitivity to errors is specific to worry vs. phobia.

However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric tests to measure divergent thinking—an important component of creativity—in a way that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We administered two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We then subjected the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to examine which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. Results show that none of the pre-registered models fit the data well, an ambiguous result that leaves unanswered the question of whether intelligence and divergent thinking tests measure the same construct. Exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) measurement models of each test separately shows that the TTCT-F may not measure a coherent, unitary construct—leading to model misspecification when TTCT-F subtests were included in larger models.

According to this framework, choices are preceded by affective, integrative, and motivational processes, which may all be affected by aging. The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task allows tapping into several mechanisms proposed by the AIM framework, and the present registered report aimed to explore the temporal resolution of the EEG to find the neural correlates of age differences in such mechanisms, including gain/loss anticipation, value integration, motivational processes underlying motor choice, as well as processing of positive/negative rewards. The electrophysiological data were recorded from 77 participants (20–80 years old), and we analyzed the Cue-P3, Contingent Negative Variation, target-P3, Feedback-related Negativity, and the Feedback-P3. The results support the AIM framework, suggesting that aging altered affective processes (as shown by a significant reduced cue-P3 in the older group), while preserved integration and motivation processes. However, despite a general lack of significant group by domain interactions across the ERPs analyzed, the results of the planned comparisons are suggestive of a preserved processing of gains and affected processing of losses during aging.

One potential determinant of trust is how leaders resolve conflicts between utilitarian and non-utilitarian ethical principles in moral dilemmas. Past research suggests that utilitarian responses to dilemmas can both erode and enhance trust in leaders: sacrificing some people to save many others (‘instrumental harm’) reduces trust, while maximizing the welfare of everyone equally (‘impartial beneficence’) may increase trust. In a multi-site experiment spanning 22 countries on six continents, participants (N = 23,929) completed self-report (N = 17,591) and behavioural (N = 12,638) measures of trust in leaders who endorsed utilitarian or non-utilitarian principles in dilemmas concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent work has questioned the uniqueness of moral distress in predicting self-reported feelings of sexual addiction, demonstrating that other so-called addictive behaviors (e.g., gaming and internet use) are well-predicted by moral disapproval of those behaviors. The present work tested if moral incongruence (the interaction of behavioral frequency and moral disapproval of a behavior) is uniquely related to sexual behavior, or if it generalizes to other addictions as well. Method: This work used a large sample (N = 4,363) involving a representative sample of the U.S. population (n = 2,806) and a sample of sports-wagering individuals in the U.S. (n = 1,557). Interactions between moral disapproval and behavioral frequency were tested for several behaviors (i.e., pornography use, gambling, and several substances). Results: The interaction of behavioral frequency and behavioral disapproval (i.e., moral incongruence) predicted self-reported feelings of addiction to pornography and gambling. Moral incongruence was consistently unrelated to self-reported feelings of addiction to tobacco, illicit substances, and prescription drugs. Results regarding alcohol and marijuana were inconclusive. Conclusions: Moral incongruence is clearly a salient factor in understanding compulsive sexual behavior, and it appears to also be salient to gambling disorder. Though moral incongruence does not seem relevant to some substances (i.e., nicotine, prescription drug misuse, or illicit drug use), further research is needed regarding the effect of moral incongruence on self-reported feelings of addiction to alcohol and marijuana.

Under which conditions does “ingroup love” turn into “outgroup hate”? Studies with natural groups suggest that when group membership is based on (dis)similarity of moral beliefs, people are willing to not only help the ingroup, but also harm the outgroup. The key limitation of these studies is that the use of natural groups confounds the effects of shared morality with the history of intergroup relations. We tested the effect of morality-based group membership on intergroup behavior using artificial groups that help disentangling these effects. We used the recently developed Intergroup Parochial and Universal Cooperation (IPUC) game which differentiates between behavioral options of weak parochialism (helping the ingroup), strong parochialism (harming the outgroup), universal cooperation (helping both groups), and egoism (profiting individually). In three preregistered experiments, we find that morality-based groups exhibit less egoism and more universal cooperation than non-morality-based groups. We also find some evidence of stronger ingroup favoritism in morality-based groups, but no evidence of stronger outgroup hostility. Stronger ingroup favoritism in morality-based groups is driven by expectations from the ingroup, but not the outgroup. These findings contradict earlier evidence from natural groups and suggest that (dis)similarity of moral beliefs is not sufficient to cross the boundary between “ingroup love” and “outgroup hate”.",2023-03-01,2023-02-24 18:01:51,2023-02-24T18:01:51Z,2023-02-24 18:01:51,104436,,,105,,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Helping the ingroup versus harming the outgroup,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Cooperation; Economic game; Ingroup bias; Morality; Prejudice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other theories suggest that sleep's role in memory is not restricted to consolidation. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that new learning is implemented in the brain through strengthening synaptic connections, a biologically costly process that gradually saturates encoding capacity during wake. During slow-wave sleep, synaptic strength is renormalized, thus restoring memory encoding ability. While the role of sleep in memory consolidation has been extensively documented, few human studies have explored the impact of sleep in restoring encoding ability, and none have looked at learning beyond episodic memory. In this registered report we test the predictions made by the complementary learning systems accounts and the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis regarding adult participants' ability to learn new words, and to integrate these words with existing knowledge. Participants took a polysomnographically-monitored daytime nap or remained awake prior to learning a set of new spoken words. Shortly after learning, and again on the following day, we measured participants' episodic memory for new words. We also assessed the degree to which newly learned words engage in competition with existing words. We predicted that sleep before encoding would result in better episodic memory for the words, and facilitate the overnight integration of new words with existing words. Based on existing literature and theory we further predicted that this restorative function is associated with slow-wave and sleep spindle activity. Our pre-registered analyses did not find a significant benefit of napping prior to encoding on word learning or integration. Exploratory analyses using a more sensitive measure of recall accuracy demonstrated significantly better performance in the nap condition compared to the no-nap condition in the immediate test. At the delayed test there was no longer a significant benefit of the nap. Of note, we found no significant effect of slow-wave activity prior to encoding on episodic memory or integration of newly learned words into the mental lexicon. However, we found that greater levels of Stage 2 sleep spindles were significantly associated with greater improvements in lexical competition from the immediate to the delayed test. Therefore, our results demonstrate some support for theories that implicate sleep spindles in restoring encoding capacity.",2023-02-01,2023-02-24 16:41:28,2023-02-24T16:41:28Z,2023-02-24 16:41:28,142-166,,,159,,Cortex,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Complementary learning systems; Daytime napping; Language learning; Sleep; Synaptic homeostasis hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is substantial evidence that (low) agreeableness is arguably the most important personality correlate of various antisocial behaviours, this evidence is descriptive and provides little information on the direction or processes underlying the relation. Process–related research has started to provide more insight into how agreeableness–related traits give rise to various antisocial and prosocial behaviours. The proposed study looked to first replicate previous research on some of the potential cognitive–emotional processes related to agreeableness and then conduct exploratory analyses to identify which, if any, of the empirically identified facets of agreeableness bear specific relations to the processes under study.

Many accounts predict that human prosociality would increase in the presence of observing individuals. Previous studies on this observability effect predominantly relied on artificial observability manipulations and low-cost measures of prosociality. In the present Registered Report, we used a recently validated laboratory procedure of repeated dilemmas to test whether the presence of actual observers affects costly prosocial behaviour in the domain of environmental conservation. When completing this dilemma task, participants repeatedly chose between minimizing the length of the laboratory session and minimising wasted energy from a bank of LED lights. Their choices were made either in private or in the presence of actual observers. Contrary to our expectation, we did not observe higher rates of energy-conserving behaviour when participants' choices were being observed. Manipulation and robustness checks indicate that this lack of a finding is unlikely to be owing to arbitrary methodological choices. In view of these findings, we argue that a more comprehensive analysis of situation- and behaviour-specific consequences might be necessary to predict how particular behaviours are affected by observability.",,2021-03-10 09:59:26,2021-03-10T09:59:26Z,2021-03-03 15:00:22,190189,,4,7,,Royal Society Open Science,Green when seen?,,,,,,,,,,,,royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon),,00006  Publisher: Royal Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, unfamiliar faces are encountered only once, and so they do not benefit from such richness of experience and are represented based on image-specific details. In this registered report, we used a repeat detection task to test whether familiar faces are recognized better than unfamiliar faces across image changes. Participants viewed a stream of more than 1000 celebrity face images for 0.5 s each, any of which might be repeated at a later point and has to be detected. Some participants saw the same image at repeats, while others saw a different image of the same face. A post-experimental familiarity check allowed us to determine which celebrities were and were not familiar to each participant. We had three predictions: (i) detection would be better for familiar than unfamiliar faces, (ii) detection would be better across same rather than different images, and (iii) detection of familiar faces would be comparable across same and different images, but detection of unfamiliar faces would be poorer across different images. We obtained support for the first two predictions but not the last. Instead, we found that repeat detection of faces, regardless of familiarity, was poorer across different images.

In their second experiment, Kornell and Bjork showed with a final style recognition test, that spacing resulted in better inductive learning than massing. Also, by using this style recognition test, they ruled out the possibility that spacing merely resulted in a better memory for the labels of the newly learned painting styles. The findings from Kornell and Bjork’s second experiment are important because they show that the benefit of spaced learning generalizes to complex learning tasks and outcomes, and that it is not confined to rote memory learning. However, the findings from Kornell and Bjork’s second experiment have never been replicated. In the present study we performed an exact and high-powered replication of Kornell and Bjork’s second experiment with a Web-based sample. Such a replication contributes to establish the reliability of the original finding and hence to more conclusive evidence of the spacing effect in inductive learning. The findings from the present replication attempt revealed a medium-sized advantage of spacing over massing in inductive learning, which was comparable to the original effect in the experiment by Kornell and Bjork.

FN8G6G6H,journalArticle,2019,"Grubb, Michael A.; Christensen, Gabriela; Albanese, John",Investigating the role of exogenous cueing on selection history formation,Psychonomic Bulletin & Review,,1531-5320,10/gfzvxg,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-019-01591-z,"An abundance of recent empirical data suggest that repeatedly allocating visual attention to task-relevant and/or reward-predicting features in the visual world engenders an attentional bias for these frequently attended stimuli, even when they become task irrelevant and no longer predict reward. In short, attentional selection in the past hinders voluntary control of attention in the present. But do such enduring attentional biases rely on a history of voluntary, goal-directed attentional selection, or can they be generated through involuntary, effortless attentional allocation? An abrupt visual onset triggers such a reflexive allocation of covert spatial attention to its location in the visual field, automatically modulating numerous aspects of visual perception. In this Registered Report, we asked whether a selection history that has been reflexively and involuntarily derived (i.e., through abrupt-onset cueing) also interferes with goal-directed attentional control, even in the complete absence of exogenous cues. To build spatially distinct histories of exogenous selection, we presented abrupt-onset cues twice as often at one of two task locations, and as expected, these cues reflexively modulated visual processing: task accuracy increased, and response times (RTs) decreased, when the cue appeared near the target’s location, relative to that of the distractor. Upon removal of these cues, however, we found no evidence that exogenous selection history modulated task performance: task accuracy and RTs at the previously most-cued and previously least-cued sides were statistically indistinguishable. Thus, unlike voluntarily directed attention, involuntary attentional allocation may not be sufficient to engender historically contingent selection biases.",2019-03-28,2019-10-31 20:39:05,2019-10-31T20:39:05Z,2019-04-16 18:21:52,,,,,,Psychon Bull Rev,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,Exogenous attention; Selection history; Spatial attention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing research has used cross-sectional designs with easy-to-obtain but unreliable self-report measures of playtime, or, in rare instances, obtained industry data on objectively-tracked playtime but only for individual games, not a player’s total playtime across games. Further, researchers have raised concerns that publication bias and a lack of differentiation between exploratory and confirmatory research have undermined the credibility of the evidence base. As a result, we still do not know whether wellbeing affects playtime, playtime affects wellbeing, both, or neither. To track people’s playtime across multiple games, we developed a method to log playtime on the Xbox platform. In a 12-week, 6-wave panel study of adult US/UK Xbox-predominant players (414 players, 2036 completed surveys), we investigated within-person temporal relations between objectively-measured playtime and wellbeing. Across multiple preregistered model specifications, we found that the within-person prospective relationships between playtime and wellbeing, or vice versa, were not practically significant—even the largest associations were unlikely to register a perceptible impact on a player’s wellbeing.  These results support the growing body of evidence that playtime is not the primary factor in the relationship between gaming and mental health for the majority of players, and that research focus should be on the context and quality of gameplay instead.",2024-01-12,2024-01-13 07:59:55,2024-01-13T07:59:55Z,2024-01-12 15:18:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en-us,,,,,osf.io,,Publisher: OSF Citation Key: Ballou-2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite extensive research on the costs and benefits of these states, our understanding of the relationship between mind-wandering, boredom, attention, and memory remains limited. In the proposed study, we wish to examine the impact that mind-wandering and boredom during encoding have on recognition. In particular, we seek to investigate what impact mind-wandering and boredom have during the encoding of visual material on the pupil old/new effect at recognition of the same material. We will use an incidental memory task and measure mind-wandering and boredom with thought probes during encoding. Furthermore, we will use the pupil old/new effect assessed via eye-tracking as a measure of recognition. Will old stimuli encoded during mind-wandering and boredom elicit the same pupillary response as new stimuli, or will the pupil, during recognition, still recognize the stimulus as an old one? We predict that the encoding of stimuli during mind-wandering and boredom reduces the pupil old-new effect, in other words, we expect the difference between the pupil size during old and new stimuli to be diminished. Furthermore, we expect mind-wandering to be a better predictor than boredom.",2024,2024-01-13 07:59:46,2024-01-13T07:59:46Z,2024-01-12 16:06:11,,,,,,,Registered report (Stage 1 - preprint),,,,,,,,,,,,Europe PMC,,DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/gue36 Type: article Citation Key: Lapteva-2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers using these models often consult highly-referenced simulation studies when designing their own studies, especially for sample-size planning. However, current literature suggests two issues with this practice. First, recent efforts to replicate findings from seminal simulation studies suggest the rate of replicability is far from ideal. Second, with the growing popularity of multilevel models, researchers are now using more complex models; however, they often support their usage by referring to simulation studies conducted under much simpler conditions. To address these two issues, we propose a replication and extension of Maas &amp; Hox (2005), a widely cited study that recommended Level-2 sample sizes of N = 50 to be sufficient under specific conditions. We replicate their original core findings and propose several extensions based on a literature search of multilevel modeling practices employed in fifty recently published studies. These extensions include examining conditions with imbalanced data across higher-level units, varying the number of random slopes and cross-level interactions, and varying effect sizes. Together, these results could ensure much of the existing literature relies on a replicable simulation study while also helping inform multilevel study planning for complex models which are becoming increasingly popular in behavioral and social sciences.",2023,2023-11-10 15:37:34,2023-11-10T15:37:34Z,2023-11-10 15:36:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cc by,,,,Europe PMC,,DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/fk8jz Type: article Citation Key: GuassiMoreira-2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pioneering work on the psychological and biological roots of political orientation has suggested that political conservatism is driven in large part by enhanced negativity bias. This work has been criticized on several theoretical fronts, and recent replication attempts have failed. To dig deeper into the contours of when (and among whom) negativity bias predicts conservatism, we investigate a surprisingly overlooked factor in existing literature: race and ethnicity. We propose that political issues represent threat or disgust in different ways depending on one’s race and ethnicity. We recruited 174 White, Latinx, and Asian American individuals (in equal numbers) to examine how the relationship between negativity bias and political orientation varies by race/ethnicity across four domains: policing/criminal justice, immigration, economic redistribution, and religious social conservatism.",2022,2023-06-13 14:15:30,2023-06-13T14:15:30Z,2023-02-24 19:12:54,232-255,,2,41,,,Racial and ethnic variation in the negativity bias–ideology connection,,,,,,,en,,,,,Cambridge University Press,,Publisher: Cambridge University Press,,,,life science,biology and politics; ideology; negativity bias; physiology; race and ethnicity; recall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results have largely been interpreted as suggesting that the behavioral immune system influences preferences for these features in potential mates. However, findings are limited by small sample sizes among studies reporting supportive evidence, the use of small stimulus sets to assess preferences for symmetry and dimorphism, and design features that render implications for theory ambiguous (namely, largely only investigating women's preferences for male faces). Using a sample of 954 White young adult UK participants and a pool of 100 White young adult stimuli, the current registered report applied a standard two-alternative forced-choice approach to evaluate both men's and women's preferences for both facial symmetry and dimorphism in both same- and opposite-sex targets. Participants were randomly assigned to either a pathogen prime or a control prime, and they completed instruments assessing individual differences in pathogen avoidance (disgust sensitivity and contamination sensitivity). Results revealed overall preferences for both facial symmetry and dimorphism. However, they did not reveal a relation between these preferences and disgust sensitivity or contamination sensitivity, nor did they reveal differences in these preferences across control and pathogen prime conditions. Null results of pathogen-avoidance variables were consistent across participant sex, target sex, and interactions between participant sex and target sex. Overall, findings cast doubt on the hypothesis that pathogen-avoidance motives influence preferences for facial symmetry or dimorphism.",2022-05-01,2023-06-13 13:25:48,2023-06-13T13:25:48Z,2023-03-01 19:02:55,212-223,,3,43,,Evolution and Human Behavior,Re-evaluating the relationship between pathogen avoidance and preferences for facial symmetry and sexual dimorphism,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,life science,Behavioral immune system; Disgust; Health; Masculinity; Mate preferences; Symmetry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce treatment failures by proactively screening for patients at risk of low treatment response, gain more knowledge about risk factors, and to evaluate treatments, accurate insights about predictors of treatment response in naturalistic inpatient samples are needed. Methods We will compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting treatment response, operationalized as a substantial reduction in symptom severity as expressed in the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. To achieve this goal, we will use different sets of variables-(a) demographics, (b) medical indicators, (c) psychological indicators, and (d) treatment-related variables-in an inpatient sample to specify their joint and unique contribution to treatment success.",2022-12-22,2023-03-01 19:03:03,2023-03-01T19:03:03Z,,,,,,,,Predicting Treatment Response Using Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/fuyjv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although heavily influential, a frequent question raised is whether responses to hypothetical scenarios are informative about instances of morally relevant behavior. Using the CNI model to quantify sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms, and general preference for inaction versus action in responses to sacrificial dilemmas, two preregistered studies examined whether specific factors underlying sacrificial dilemma judgments predict dishonest behavior for personal monetary gain (Study 1) and the greater good (Study 2). Testing the hypothesis that specific factors underlying sacrificial dilemma judgments are linked to other morally relevant behaviors via broader underlying moral dispositions, confirmatory tests provide strong support the predicted associations between sensitivity to moral norms and dishonest behavior. No support was found for a predicted association between sensitivity to consequences and dishonest behavior for the greater good. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the value of individual differences in sacrificial dilemma judgments for predicting instances of morally relevant behavior.",2022-07-22,2023-02-24 21:45:32,2023-02-24T21:45:32Z,2023-02-24 21:45:32,1-28,,0,0,,,Prediction of dishonest behavior using the CNI model of moral dilemma judgment,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/23743603.2022.2102473,,,,,CNI model; deontology; dishonest behavior; moral judgment; utilitarianism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent research shows that sexual violence (versus other, less stigmatizing trauma) stories are perceived as more difficult to tell, and their storytellers as less likeable. This is true even when stories have redemptive endings, contradicting an established U.S. cultural preference for redemptive stories. However, it is unknown if sexual violence perceptions generalize to different types of interpersonal violence (IPV) and if audience perceptions vary across 3 major types of IPV (sexual, physical, psychological). This pre-registered replication and extension study investigates these questions with a vignette-based experimental design modeled after 2 published studies by the first and last authors. Broadly, we hypothesized that cultural invalidation of sexual violence stories would extend to any IPV story (vs. non-IPV traumas such as natural disasters), and that within the realm of IPV, cultural invalidation would be more pronounced for psychological violence stories (vs. sexual/physical). Three samples of U.S. adult participants (N=1,045), 2 Nationally Representative and 1 University-based, were randomly assigned online to read 1 of 12 first-person trauma story vignettes and complete self-report surveys of story and storyteller perceptions in a 6 (trauma story: IPV [k=3], non-IPV [k=3]) x 2 (ending: negative, redemptive) between-subjects design. Support for our hypotheses was mixed. IPV (vs. non-IPV) stories were perceived as more difficult to share (η2p = .068) and their storytellers as having less positive personality traits (η2p = .043), even when stories ended redemptively. However, among the 3 IPV types, psychological violence storytellers were not robustly more stigmatized, and sexual violence stories were recognized as particularly difficult to disclose. IPV survivors face obstacles to telling their stories that may hamper both personal recovery and collective momentum for systemic change.",2022-08-02,2023-02-24 21:45:23,2023-02-24T21:45:23Z,2023-02-24 21:45:23,36330,,1,8,,Collabra: Psychology,"Perceptions of Physical, Sexual, and Psychological Violence Stories",,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical area in this regard is the lack of clarity concerning the differences between gaming disorder and intensive play, the latter of which often involves several gaming hours per day without related health problems. In this study, we approached the above question by interpretive phenomenological analysis with interviews in two groups of highly involved videogame players: those who seek or have sought clinical help for their problems with gaming (n=6), and those who play esports more than 4 hours per day without self-reported related health problems (n=10). The interviews were carried out by using a new Phenomenology of Play (POP) interview frame. These data were contextualized with interviews of medical experts (n=6) who have experience of working with the former group. The findings imply that experiences of disorder derive from gaming interfering with what one wants to be, do, and have throughout life, whereas the experiences of intensive esport play derive from gaming being integrated into self throughout life. To our knowledge, this was the first registered report using qualitative phenomenological methods—we encourage researchers to explore the utility of registered reports with other qualitative methods to further optimize scientific progress.",2022-10-24,2023-02-24 21:35:37,2023-02-24T21:35:37Z,2023-02-24 21:35:33,38819,,1,8,,Collabra: Psychology,Phenomenological Strands for Gaming Disorder and Esports Play,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to investigate how screening instruments that derive from different ontologies differ in identifying associated problem groups. By using four central screening instruments, each representing a different ontological basis, we hypothesized differences and similarities in prevalence, overlap, and health. A nationally representative (N = 8217) sample of Finnish participants was collected. The screening instruments produced significantly different prevalence rates (from 0.4% to 6.9%) and the binomial probabilities of group overlap ranged from poor (0.419) to good (0.919). Expectedly, the problem groups had lower mental health than the general population, yet exploratory analyses implied equivalent or significantly higher physical health. We also found strong exploratory evidence for mischievous responding to complicate the measurement of gaming problems. Considering that several major differences were confirmed between the four gaming problem constructs, we recommend researchers to clearly define their construct of interest, i.e. whether they are studying the ICD-11 based official mental disorder, the DSM-5 proposed ‘internet gaming disorder’, or other gaming problems—especially in future meta-analyses.",2022-09-05,2023-02-24 19:12:30,2023-02-24T19:12:30Z,2023-02-24 19:12:30,1-11,,0,0,,,Ontological diversity in gaming disorder measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/16066359.2022.2115033,,,,,Behavioral addiction; games; open science; philosophy; prevalence; technology use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A seminal study by Posner et al. (Posner MI, Klein R, Summers J, Buggie S. 1973 Mem. Cognit.1, 2–12 (doi:10.3758/BF03198062)) focused on how changing the interval between an alerting signal and a target would impact the speed and accuracy of responding. Participants indicated whether targets were presented on the left or right side of the fixation point. Auditory warning signals were played at various intervals prior to the target to alert participants and prepare them to make a response. Reaction times revealed a robust, U-shaped, preparation function. Importantly, a clear speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) was observed. In the current experiment, we replicated the methodological components of this seminal study while implementing a novel auditory warning signal (Lawrence MA, Klein RM. 2013 J. Exp. Psychol. General142, 560 (doi:10.1037/a0029023)) that was either purely endogenous (change in quality without a change in intensity; analogous to isoluminant colour change in vision) or a combination of endogenous and exogenous (change in both quality and intensity).

However, it is not clear whether the same effects would be obtained also by just imagining, rather than adopting, a power pose. We planned to investigate this question by asking 200 participants to either perform or imagine a constrictive or an expansive body posture during 2 min and then measure the effect on a gambling decision task and on felt power. We followed a sequential analysis procedure by running the first 100 participants in the performed posture condition in order to check the presence of the power posing effect. Because no effect of power poses on gambling decision or on felt power was found, we ran the remaining 100 participants also in the performed instead of the imagined condition. The results after running 200 participants confirmed that power poses did not affect gambling decision. However, participants felt more powerful after adopting an expansive pose compared to a constrictive pose. Exploratory analyses found that this effect was mainly driven by male participants. In addition, participants rated themselves as being more able to adopt the expansive body posture and they reported to put more effort in adopting the restrictive body posture. Overall, our results indicate that the effect of power poses on behavior might not be as widespread as previously thought of and suggest that moderators should be investigated carefully in future research.",2017-01-02,2019-10-31 20:33:46,2019-10-31T20:33:46Z,,44-54,,1,2,,,Real and imagined power poses,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,Power pose; felt power; gambling decision; imagined pose; performed pose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research on masculine generic morphology in other gender-marked languages has shown that this can create an over-representation of men and a male-bias in perception. Given the extensive use of default masculine grammatical gender in the context of job recruitment, education, and formal communication where women are typically underrepresented and men overrepresented, this widely accepted notion needs to be investigated. The primary aim of this research is to understand how grammatical gender in Arabic mediates occupational expectations based on the language currently used in job recruitment in Arabic speaking countries. Specifically, the study explores how the use of default masculine grammatical gender can create a male-bias in perception. The secondary aim of this research is to test whether gender-inclusive language can reduce this male-bias in perception and instead increase the accessibility, activation, and retrieval of exemplars related to other gender minorities (i.e., reduce male-bias in perception). This is achieved through a novel prompted speech production experiment, based on an adaptation of the popular board game ’Taboo’ where participants are asked to describe role nouns presented (e.g., doctor or nurse) in different language conditions.",2023-10-20,2023-11-11 02:46:31,2023-11-11T02:46:31Z,2023-11-10 15:47:32,e0292936,,10,18,,PLOS ONE,Registered report protocol,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: Soliman-2023,,,,,Experimental design; Languages; Linguistic morphology; Multilingualism; Nurses; Psychological attitudes; Sexual and gender issues; Speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A5SCFUG6,book,2023,"Feldman, Gilad",Registered Report Stage 1 manuscript template,,,,,,"This Registered Report collaborative template aims to address the growing prevalence of Registered Reports. Registered Reports (http://cos.io/rr) are a new publication process now adopted by hundreds of journals across the sciences, in which journal peer review is conducted in two stages. The Stage 1 review is conducted on a pre-registration plan prior to any data collection to arrive at an agreement and an official registration of the plan, with the journal issuing an in-principle acceptance. Stage 2 review ensures that plan has been followed or that deviations have been noted and justified. Registered Report Stage 1 submissions differ from common pre-registration templates in that they look like a regular manuscript, with the following differences: 1) manuscript reflects a future plan, 2) results are written on simulated randomized data or as a data analysis plan, 3) discussion section details planned issues to discuss in Stage 2. This template is meant to structure the manuscript style pre-registration with a very detailed and comprehensive plan that would increase the potential of communicating to reviewers all needed aspects for them to be able to provide constructive helpful feedback. The template has been pre-tested extensively in over 40 submissions of the CORE team (2023) and is continuously updated and improved.

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells with the small-molecular inhibitor of BET bromodomains, (+)-JQ1, selectively downregulated MYC transcription, which is similar to what was reported in the original study (Figure 3B; Delmore et al., 2011). Efficacy of (+)-JQ1 was evaluated in an orthotopically xenografted model of MM. Overall survival was increased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control, similar to the original study (Figure 7E; Delmore et al., 2011). Tumor burden, as determined by bioluminescence, was decreased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7C-D; Delmore et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. The opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference was limited though, due to the higher rate of early death in the control group, and increased overall survival in (+)-JQ1 treated mice before the pre-specified tumor burden analysis endpoint. Additionally, we evaluated the (−)-JQ1 enantiomer that is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains, which resulted in a minimal impact on MYC transcription, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in tumor burden or survival distributions compared to treatment with (+)-JQ1.

We found that treatment of immune competent mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors with anti-mouse CD47 antibodies resulted in short-term anemia compared to controls, consistent with the previously described function of CD47 in normal phagocytosis of aging red blood cells and results reported in the original study (Table S4; Willingham et al., 2012). The weight of tumors after 30 days administration of anti-CD47 antibodies or IgG isotype control were not found to be statistically different, whereas the original study reported inhibition of tumor growth with anti-CD47 treatment (Figure 6A,B; Willingham et al., 2012). However, our efforts to replicate this experiment were confounded because spontaneous regression of tumors occurred in several of the mice. Additionally, the excised tumors were scored for inflammatory cell infiltrates. We found IgG and anti-CD47 treated tumors resulted in minimal to moderate lymphocytic infiltrate, while the original study observed sparse lymphocytic infiltrate in IgG-treated tumors and increased inflammatory cell infiltrates in anti-CD47 treated tumors (Figure 6C; Willingham et al., 2012). Furthermore, we observed neutrophilic infiltration was slightly increased in anti-CD47 treated tumors compared to IgG control.

Here we report the results of those experiments. We regenerated cells stably expressing ectopic wild-type and mutant phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) using the same immortalized human NRASG12D melanocytes as the original study. Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression. The monitoring of tumor formation of these stable cells in vivo resulted in no statistically significant difference in tumor-free survival driven by PREX2 variants, whereas the original study reported that these PREX2 mutations increased the rate of tumor incidence compared to controls (Figure 3B and S6B; Berger et al., 2012). Surprisingly, the median tumor-free survival was 1 week in this replication attempt, while 70% of the control mice were reported to be tumor-free after 9 weeks in the original study. The rapid tumor onset observed in this replication attempt, compared to the original study, makes the detection of accelerated tumor growth in PREX2 expressing NRASG12D melanocytes extremely difficult.

Further, in mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors, we did not find a statistically significant difference in tumor weight for mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, whereas the original study reported a decrease in tumor weight when DOX was coadministered with iRGD (Figure 2C; Sugahara et al., 2010).

How diversity is associated with outcomes of interest is particularly susceptible to the production of nonreplicable findings given the very large number of alternative measures applied to several policy relevant attributes such as race, ethnicity, gender, or foreign-born status. The very large number of alternative measures substantially increases the probability of false discovery where nominally significant parameter estimates—selected through numerous though unreported specification tests—may not be representative of true associations in the population. The purpose of this registered report is to: 1) select a single measure of ownership diversity that satisfies explicit, requisite axioms; 2) split the Annual Business Survey (ABS) into an exploratory sample (35%) used in this analysis and a confirmatory sample (65%) that will be accessed only after the publication of this report; 3) regress self-reported new-to-market innovation on the diversity measure along with industry and firm-size controls; 4) pass through those variables meeting precision and magnitude criteria for hypothesis testing using the confirmatory sample; and 5) document the full set of hypotheses to be tested in the final analysis along with a discussion of the false discovery and family-wise error rate corrections to be applied.

Large-scale replication attempts for psychological results yielded shockingly low success rates and contributed to an increasing demand for open science practices among psychologists. However, preregistering one’s studies is still not the norm in the field. Here, we conducted a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy. Methods In a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an online survey assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Respondents (N = 289) were psychological researchers that were recruited through their publications on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predicted that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers’ intention to preregister (directional hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expected an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (non-directional hypothesis 2). We analyzed these hypotheses with multiple regression models and included preregistration experience as a control variable. Results Researchers’ attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and the perceived importance of preregistration significantly predicted researchers’ intention to use preregistration in the future (see hypothesis 1). Research experience influenced both researchers’ attitudes and their perception of motivations to preregister, but not the perception of obstacles (see hypothesis 2). Descriptive reports on researchers’ attitudes, motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration are provided. Discussion Many researchers had already preregistered and had a rather positive attitude toward preregistration. Nevertheless, several obstacles were identified that may be addressed to improve and foster preregistration.",2023-03-16,2023-04-11 17:19:46,2023-04-11T17:19:46Z,2023-04-11 17:19:44,e0281086,,3,18,,PLOS ONE,Registered report,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,,,,Behavior; Careers; Motivation; Open science; Pilot studies; Psychological attitudes; Psychology; Surveys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seemingly, this resulted in few experiments using financial incentives (e.g., money, vouchers) as a strategy to motivate the participants' behavior; which is typically done in other research communities, such as economics or psychology. Even the current version of the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards does mention payouts for completing surveys only, but not for mimicking the real-world or motivating realistic behavior during experiments. So, there is a lack of understanding regarding whether financial incentives can or cannot be useful for software-engineering experimentation. To tackle this problem, we plan a survey based on which we will conduct a controlled laboratory experiment. Precisely, we will use the survey to elicit incentivization schemes we will employ as (up to) four payoff functions (i.e., mappings of choices or performance in an experiment to a monetary payment) during a code-review task in the experiment: (1) a scheme that employees prefer, (2) a scheme that is actually employed, (3) a scheme that is performance-independent, and (4) a scheme that mimics an open-source scenario. Using a between-subject design, we aim to explore how the different schemes impact the participants' performance.

The present research explored how features of measured attributes and individual differences affect the relationship between implicit and explicit measures using existing data (Hussey, Hughes, & Nosek, 2018). In the original study, participants completed measures of explicit evaluation or identification (i.e., difference scores between self-report items) and implicit evaluation or identification (i.e., the Implicit Association Test; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) for one of 95 target pairs. First, we attempted to conceptually replicate Nosek's (2005) findings that self-presentation, distinctiveness, elaboration/importance, and complementarity moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations across individuals irrespective of attribute targets. These attribute features each moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations and accounted for unique variation in implicit-explicit relations. Second, we tested whether these features affected the relationship between implicit and explicit identifications. We found moderating effects of distinctiveness and complementarity but not of the other attribute features, likely due to their operationalization. Finally, we examined whether theoretically relevant individual difference measures moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations or identifications. Across almost all analyses, these measures (i.e., socially desirable responding, self-monitoring, need for cognition, personal need for structure, and need for cognitive closure) did not moderate implicit-explicit relations. Taken together, our results suggest that relationships between implicit and explicit measures reflect individual experiences with attribute targets rather than the cultural context, targets, or individuals themselves.",2022-05-01,2023-02-24 21:39:37,2023-02-24T21:39:37Z,2023-02-24 21:39:37,104280,,,100,,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Registered report,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Implicit bias; Implicit measures; Implicit-explicit relations; Individual differences; Moderation; Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this prediction in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game, where 1,280 practising Christian believers were paired with either a coreligionist or an atheist and where time limits were used to increase reliance on either intuitive or deliberated decisions. We explored another dual-process account of cooperation, the self-control account (SCA), which suggests that visceral reactions tend to be selfish and that cooperation requires deliberation. We found evidence for religious parochialism but no support for SHH’s prediction of intuitive cooperation.

However, the particular facial regions that guide such trustworthiness judgements are largely unknown. It is also unclear whether different facial regions are consistently utilized to guide judgments for different ethnic groups, and whether previous exposure to specific ethnicities in one’s social environment has an influence on trustworthiness judgements made from faces or facial regions. This registered report addressed these questions through a global online survey study that recruited Asian, Black, Latino, and White raters (N = 4580). Raters were shown full faces and specific parts of the face for an ethnically diverse, sex-balanced set of 32 targets and rated targets’ trustworthiness. Multilevel modelling showed that in forming trustworthiness judgements, raters relied most strongly on the eyes (with no substantial information loss vis-à-vis full faces). Corroborating ingroup–outgroup effects, raters rated faces and facial parts of targets with whom they shared their ethnicity, sex, or eye color as significantly more trustworthy. Exposure to ethnic groups in raters’ social environment predicted trustworthiness ratings of other ethnic groups in nuanced ways. That is, raters from the ambient ethnic majority provided slightly higher trustworthiness ratings for stimuli of their own ethnicity compared to minority ethnicities. In contrast, raters from an ambient ethnic minority (e.g., immigrants) provided substantially lower trustworthiness ratings for stimuli of the ethnic majority. Taken together, the current study provides a new window into the psychological processes underlying social face evaluation and its cultural generalizability.",2022-10-31,2023-02-24 19:14:00,2023-02-24T19:14:00Z,2023-02-24 19:14:00,18311,,1,12,,Sci Rep,Registered report,,,,,,,en,2022 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,,Human behaviour; Social evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some neuroimaging studies report cerebellar involvement whereas others do not. This discrepancy may stem from underpowered studies, differences in statistical modeling or variation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and processing. To resolve this, we investigated the cerebellar structural differences using a local advanced ET dataset augmented by matched controls from PPMI and ADNI. We tested the hypothesis of cerebellar involvement using three neuroimaging biomarkers: VBM, gray/white matter volumetry and lobular volumetry. Furthermore, we assessed the impacts of statistical models and segmentation pipelines on results. Results indicate that the detected cerebellar structural changes vary with methodology. Significant reduction of right cerebellar gray matter and increase of the left cerebellar white matter were the only two biomarkers consistently identified by multiple methods.

However, the particular facial regions that guide such trustworthiness judgements are largely unknown. It is also unclear whether different facial regions are consistently utilized to guide judgments for different ethnic groups, and whether previous exposure to specific ethnicities in one’s social environment has an influence on trustworthiness judgements made from faces or facial regions. This registered report addressed these questions through a global online survey study that recruited Asian, Black, Latino, and White raters (N = 4580). Raters were shown full faces and specific parts of the face for an ethnically diverse, sex-balanced set of 32 targets and rated targets’ trustworthiness. Multilevel modelling showed that in forming trustworthiness judgements, raters relied most strongly on the eyes (with no substantial information loss vis-à-vis full faces). Corroborating ingroup–outgroup effects, raters rated faces and facial parts of targets with whom they shared their ethnicity, sex, or eye color as significantly more trustworthy. Exposure to ethnic groups in raters’ social environment predicted trustworthiness ratings of other ethnic groups in nuanced ways. That is, raters from the ambient ethnic majority provided slightly higher trustworthiness ratings for stimuli of their own ethnicity compared to minority ethnicities. In contrast, raters from an ambient ethnic minority (e.g., immigrants) provided substantially lower trustworthiness ratings for stimuli of the ethnic majority. Taken together, the current study provides a new window into the psychological processes underlying social face evaluation and its cultural generalizability.",2022-10-31,2023-02-24 19:13:09,2023-02-24T19:13:09Z,2023-02-24 19:13:09,18311,,1,12,,Sci Rep,Registered report,,,,,,,en,2022 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,,Human behaviour; Social evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frailty is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Many validated instruments to detect frailty have been developed. Using these in clinical practice takes time. Automated estimation of the probability of being frail using routinely collected data from hospital electronic health records (EHRs) would circumvent that. We aim to identify potential predictors that could be used as features for modeling algorithms on the basis of routine hospital EHR data to incorporate in an automated tool for estimating the probability of being frail. Methods PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL Plus, Embase, and Web of Science will be searched. The studied population consists of older people (≥65 years). The first step is searching articles published ≥2018. Second, we add two published literature reviews (and the articles included therein) [Bery 2020; Bouillon, 2013] to our search results. In these reviews, articles on potential predictor variables in frailty screening tools were included from inception until March 2018. The goal is to identify and extract all potential predictors of being frail. Domain experts will be consulted to evaluate the results. Discussion The results of the intended study will increase the quality of the developed algorithms to be used for automated estimation of the probability of being frail in secondary care. This is a promising perspective, being less labor-intensive compared to screening each individual patient by hand. Also, such an automated tool may raise awareness of frailty, especially in those patients who would not be screened for frailty by hand because they seem robust. Conclusion The identified potential predictors of being frail can be used as evidence-based input for machine learning based automated estimation of the probability of being frail using routine EHR data in the near future.",2022-09-27,2023-02-24 19:13:00,2023-02-24T19:13:00Z,2023-02-24 19:13:00,e0275230,,9,17,,PLOS ONE,Registered report protocol,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,,,,Database searching; Electronic medical records; Frailty; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Medical risk factors; Supervised machine learning; Systematic reviews,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using ACHN renal cell carcinoma cells did not differ from vehicle control treatment, similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 1; Sirota et al., 2011). Doxorubicin treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not result in a statistically significant difference compared to vehicle control despite tumor volume being reduced to levels similar to those reported in the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011).

As a result, there is currently limited evidence that prediction is a viable learning mechanism in infancy. This study targets the role of prediction in early word encoding to assess the viability of such a learning mechanism. To achieve this, we have adapted an adult EEG study focusing on syllabic prediction (Vidal et al., 2019) for an infant population. Our study starts with a learning phase, in which 39 nine-month-old infants hear two trisyllabic pseudowords. These words are then used as standard stimuli in an oddball-phase with four new words. Two of these deviant words only share their first syllable with a familiar word while the other two share their first two syllables. We will measure whether infants’ mismatch-response (MMR) differs between standard and deviant words, to address whether 9-month-olds make phonemic-level predictions. We willalso assess the MMR-difference between the two kinds of deviants. An MMR difference after one versus two shared syllables would suggest that cumulative congruent input reinforces prediction. As infants’ MMR can vary, we will also carry out a second task to localize the individual MMR responses of each participant in the form of a tone-change-detection Optimum-1 task. This task will determine the location, latency and polarity of the MMR for each infant separately, and will ensure that the study has sufficient statistical power.",2024-01-10,2024-04-06 02:29:41,2024-04-06T02:29:41Z,2024-04-05 14:42:01,,,,,,,The babe with the predictive power,,,,,,,en-uk,,Other,,,,,Citation Key: Fazekas-2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo research has unique characteristics not shared with clinical research, meaning approaches to systematic review must be adapted to this context. We aim to evaluate the quantity, characteristics, and transparent reporting in systematic reviews which synthesise research using genetically-modified animals to model NDCs.  Methods: On 23 January 2023, we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science Core Collection to identify systematic reviews synthesising research using genetically-modified animals to model NDCs where the modified gene is one of a list of 102 genes associated with NDCs identified through large-scale exome sequencing, or FMR1, MECP2, or UBE3A. Two independent reviewers screened studies based on full text and extracted data from included reviews. We assessed the reporting quality of each included review using an adapted version of the PRISMA checklist (PRISMA-Pre).   Results: Twelve reviews met our criteria. We found mixed levels of reporting, with some items such as identifying the publication as a systematic review in the title, search strategies, and funding sources being well reported, and others such as protocol registration and data sharing less well reported.

Different concepts to determine the rate of displacement (Vc) from the maximum twitch exist, but information on their reproducibility is scarce. Further, different inter-stimuli intervals during progressive stimulation are used, but the effect of different intervals on Vc is unclear. Objectives The first aim of this study was to investigate the within and between-day reliability of the five most frequently used Vc concepts. The second aim was to investigate the effect of different inter-stimuli intervals on Vc. Methods On two consecutive days, we determined Vc of the biceps femoris long head and rectus femoris of twenty-four healthy subjects. The maximum displacement was determined twice within three minutes on day one and a third time 24 h later. Also, on day two, we applied three blocks of ten consecutive stimuli at a constant intensity of 50 mA, separated by 3 min each. Inter-stimuli intervals in randomly ordered blocks were 10 s, 20 s or 30 s, respectively. Results All Vc concepts displayed good to excellent relative (ICC 0.87–0.99) and generally good absolute within- and between-day reliability for both muscles. Across Vc-concepts, absolute reliability was higher for the rectus femoris (CV% 1.3–7.95%) compared to the biceps femoris (CV% 6.06–15.30%). In both muscles, Vc was generally not affected by different inter-stimuli intervals. For most Vc concepts, repeated stimulation induced an increase regardless of the inter-stimuli interval, but this effect was mainly trivial and small at most. Conclusions The reproducibility of Vc concepts was generally good but varies between different muscles. A rest interval of 10 s seems preferable to longer intervals for less time required per measurement. Following this initial study, the effect of different inter-stimuli intervals on Vc should be further investigated.",2023-08-02,2023-08-22 14:43:42,2023-08-22T14:43:42Z,2023-08-21 13:55:23,e0288806,,8,18,,PLOS ONE,Reproducibility of knee extensor and flexor contraction velocity in healthy men and women assessed using tensiomyography,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: langenReproducibilityKneeExtensor2023,,,,,Fatigue; Functional electrical stimulation; Muscle analysis; Muscle contraction; Physical activity; Research validity; Skeletal muscles; Time measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike quantified sentences (e.g., “Many  Germans are efficient”), generics are very unspecific about how prevalent a property is in a group. This  talk reviews puzzling findings on their acceptance conditions and perceived implications. For example,  generics are often accepted at surprisingly low prevalence levels and are highly resistant to  counterexamples. This makes generics an ideal vehicle to transmit stereotypes. We therefore present  a study that aims to uncover the puzzling acceptance conditions of generic sentences. To this aim, we  will manipulate sentence type (generic or quantified), absolute prevalence (high, intermediate, low),  relative prevalence (positive, equal, negative), and property type (physical, biological-behavioral,  cultural-behavioral). On each trial, participants will see a contingency table showing the prevalence  levels of a specific property in two alien groups living on a faraway planet. Participants will judge the  acceptability of a sentence prescribing the property to one of the alien groups. One group of  participants will judge the acceptability of quantified sentences and the other group will judge the  acceptability of generic sentences. The acceptability of the quantified sentences is hypothesized to  depend on absolute prevalence, while the acceptability of generic sentences is hypothesized to depend  on relative prevalence. The study is meant to be submitted as a registered report. Therefore, we will  also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of registered reports and will strongly welcome  questions and comments.",2023-05-26,2023-08-22 14:43:31,2023-08-22T14:43:31Z,2023-08-21 14:21:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lirias.kuleuven.be,,Citation Key: hermansCausalInfluenceAbsolute2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"76th Annual Meeting Belgian Association for Psychological Sciences, Date: 2023/05/26 - 2023/05/26, Location: University of Mons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may be particularly salient in youth who face concurrent challenges such as establishing autonomy and making vocational choices. Objective: The aim of the study was to estimate stigma prevalence in youth (aged 14-24 years) with type 1 diabetes and its associations with glycemic control. Methods: Participants, recruited largely through social media, were asked to complete a Web-based survey and to send via mail capillary blood samples for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement. The primary definition of stigma required endorsement of one or more of 3 stigma-specific items of the Barriers to Diabetes Adherence questionnaire. These addressed avoidance of diabetes management with friends present, difficulty telling others about diabetes diagnosis, and embarrassment in performing diabetes care with others present. Poor glycemic control was defined as HbA1c>9% (ie, >75 mmol/mol; measured value when available, else self-report) and/or ≥1 severe hypoglycemic episode in the previous year (reported requiring assistance from someone else during the episode). Stigma prevalence was computed (95% CI), and associations with glycemic control were evaluated (multivariate logistic regression models). Results: Among the 380 respondents, stigma prevalence was 65.5% (95% CI 60.7-70.3). Stigma was associated with a 2-fold higher odds of poor glycemic control overall (odds ratio [OR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.33-3.80; adjusted for age, sex, and type of treatment). There were specific associations with both HbA1c>9% (75 mmol/mol; OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.36-6.86) and severe hypoglycemia in the previous year (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.05-3.31). Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of stigma in youth with type 1 diabetes that is associated with both elevated HbA1c levels and severe hypoglycemia. Targeted strategies to address stigma are needed.

Currently, there is scarce evidence in support of a noradrenergic mechanism of taVNS and limited knowledge on its stimulation parameters (i.e., intensity and pulse width). Therefore, the present study aimed to test whether taVNS enhances pupil dilation, a noradrenergic biomarker, as a function of stimulation parameters. Forty-nine participants received sham (i.e., left ear earlobe) and taVNS (i.e., left ear cymba concha) stimulation in two separate sessions, in a counterbalanced order. We administered short bursts (5s) of seven stimulation settings varying as a function of pulse width and intensity and measured pupil size in parallel. Each stimulation setting was administered sixteen times in separate blocks. We expected short bursts of stimulation to elicit phasic noradrenergic activity as indexed by event-related pupil dilation and event-related temporal derivative. We hypothesised higher stimulation settings, quantified as the total charge per pulse (pulse width x intensity), to drive greater event-related pupil dilation and temporal derivative in the taVNS compared to sham condition. Specifically, we expected stimulation settings in the taVNS condition to be associated with a linear increase in event-related pupil dilation and temporal derivative. We found stimulation settings to linearly increase both pupil measures. In line with our hypothesis, the observed dose-dependent effect was stronger in the taVNS condition. We also found taVNS to elicit more intense and unpleasant sensations than sham stimulation. These results support the hypothesis of a noradrenergic mechanism of taVNS. However, future studies should disentangle whether stimulation elicited sensations mediate the effect of taVNS on evoked pupil dilation.",2023-02-01,2023-06-13 16:13:25,2023-06-13T16:13:25Z,2023-02-24 16:43:44,233-253,,,159,,Cortex,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,life science,Noradrenaline; Norepinephrine; Pupil dilation; Stimulation parameters; taVNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JJYI56IZ,journalArticle,2023,"Yarrow, K.",Spatial attention is not affected by alpha or beta transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation: a registered report,Cortex,,0010-9452,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/30166/,"Using Electroencephalography (EEG) an event-related change in alpha activity has been observed over primary sensory cortices during the allocation of spatial attention. This is most prominent during top-down, or endogenous, attention, and nearly absent in bottom-up, or exogenous orienting. These changes are highly lateralised, such that an increase in alpha power is seen ipsilateral to the attended region of space and a decrease is seen contralaterally. Whether these changes in alpha oscillatory activity are causally related to attentional resources, or to perceptual processes, or are simply epiphenomenal, is unknown. If alpha oscillations are indicative of a causal mechanism whereby attention is allocated to a region of space, it remains an open question as to whether this is driven by ipsilateral increases or contralateral decreases in alpha power. This preregistered report set out to test these questions. To do so, we used transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) to modulate alpha activity in the somatosensory cortex whilst measuring performance on established tactile attention paradigms. All participants completed an endogenous and exogenous tactile attention task in three stimulation conditions; alpha, sham and beta. Sham and beta stimulation operated as controls so that any observed effects could be attributed to alpha stimulation specifically. We replicated previous behavioural findings in all stimulation conditions showing a facilitation of cued trials in the endogenous task, and inhibition of return in the exogenous task. However, these were not affected by stimulation manipulations. Using Bayes-factor analysis we show strong support for the null hypotheses – that the manipulation of Alpha by tACS does not cause changes in tactile spatial attention. This well-powered study, conducted over three separate days, is an important contribution to the current debate regarding the efficiency of brain stimulation.",2023-03-30,2023-05-01 07:00:02,2023-05-01T07:00:02Z,2023-04-14 17:01:46,,,,,,,Spatial attention is not affected by alpha or beta transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation,,,,,,,en,cc_by_nc_nd_4,,,,openaccess.city.ac.uk,,Publisher: Elsevier,,,,,⛔ No DOI found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.; Lawrence, Alistair B.",Stage 1 Registered Report: Refinement of tickling protocols to improve positive animal welfare in laboratory rats,,,,,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1053,"Rat tickling is a heterospecific interaction for experimenters to mimic the interactions of rat play, where they produce 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USV), symptoms of positive affect; tickling can improve laboratory rat welfare. The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.",2022-11-18,2023-02-24 21:40:02,2023-02-24T21:40:02Z,2023-02-24 21:40:02,,,,,,,Stage 1 Registered Report,,,,,F1000Research,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,,,f1000research.com,,DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.125649.2 Type: article,,,,,affective neuroscience; laboratory animal welfare; playful handling; positive animal welfare; protocol; rat tickling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11:1053,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our knowledge is limited concerning both the universality of these effects outside the United States and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters, replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters, suggesting it is culturally universal.

The technique used for eliciting an effect is the ganzfeld condition (a form of sensory homogenization that eliminates distracting peripheral noise). The database consists of studies published between January 1974 and December 2020 inclusive. The overall effect size estimated both with a frequentist and a Bayesian random-effect model, were in close agreement yielding an effect size of .099 (.05-.14). This result passed four publication bias tests and seems not contaminated by questionable research practices. Trend analysis carried out with a cumulative meta-analysis and a meta-regression model with Year of publication as covariate did not indicate a sign of the decline of this effect size. The moderators' analyses show that selected participants' outcomes were almost three times those obtained by non-selected participants and that tasks that simulate telepathic communication show a two-fold effect size with respect to tasks requiring the participants to guess a target.

Setting: longitudinal online survey experiment. Participants: 2305 census-matched UK residents recruited through the survey panel firm YouGov. Primary outcome measure: comprehension of harms and benefits and knowledge recall after six weeks. Results: fact boxes—simple tabular messages—led to more comprehension (d = 0.39) and slightly more knowledge recall after six weeks (d = 0.12) compared to the same information in text. These patterns of results were consistent between the two medical topics and across all levels of objective numeracy and education. Fact boxes were rated as more engaging than text, and there were no differences between formats in treatment decisions, feeling informed or trust. Conclusions: the brief table format of the fact box improved the comprehension of harms and benefits relative to the text-only control. Effective communication supports informed consent and decision-making and brings ethical and practical advantages.

In 1977, Amos Tversky published a highly influential feature-based model of how people judge the similarity between objects. The model highlights the context-dependence of similarity judgments, and challenged geometric models of similarity. One of the context-dependent effects Tversky describes is the diagnosticity principle. The diagnosticity principle determines which features are used to cluster multiple objects into subgroups. Perceived similarity between items within clusters is expected to increase, while similarity between items in different clusters decreases. Here, we present two pre-registered replications of the studies on the diagnosticity effect reported in Tversky (1977). Additionally, one alternative mechanism that has been proposed to play a role in the original studies, an increase in the choice for distractor items (a substitution effect, see Medin et al., 1995), is examined. Our results replicate those found by Tversky (1977), revealing an average diagnosticity-effect of 4.75%. However, when we eliminate the possibility of substitution effects confounding the results, a meta-analysis of the data provides no indication of any remaining effect of diagnosticity.",2014,2021-01-06 14:42:08,2021-01-06T14:42:08Z,2016-08-31 16:58:55,875,,,5,,Front.

The present article explores the validity of such an implicit measure by proposing several extensions and adaptions. We addressed methodological problems of a me/not-me response latency task developed in this literature by proposing changes in material, calculation of indices and implemented the task in an online environment. We also addressed earlier problems with statistical power and proposed a more powerful way of statistical analyses using mixed models. The me/not-me task is based on the idea that higher overlap between self and other traits results in faster response times of characterizing such a trait as descriptive of the self. This relationship should be observed for close others but not for non-close others. In a sample of 339 U.S American adults, we experimentally manipulated the nature of the target (close vs. distant) and participants engaged in the adapted me/not-me paradigm. Results indicated that trait match had a stronger negative effect on response times for participants in the close condition. The effect was also stronger for participants rating the target higher on the IOS self-report scale. We also provided convergent validity of the me/not-me procedure with other constructs ostensibly measuring interpersonal closeness. Future applications and possible limitations are discussed.",2017-04-28,2021-01-06 14:42:01,2021-01-06T14:42:01Z,2017-05-04 11:42:58,1-24,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,Inclusion of the other in the self; implicit measure; interpersonal closeness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robust research on the impact of mobile technology interventions for these patients remains scarce. Objective: The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of individually tailored short text messages on the rate of psychiatric hospital readmissions, health care service use, and clinical outcomes. In addition, we analyzed treatment costs. Methods: Between September 2011 and November 2012, we randomly assigned 1139 people to a tailored text message intervention (n=569) or usual care (n=570). Participants received semiautomated text messages for up to 12 months or usual care. The primary outcome, based on routinely collected health register data, was patient readmission into a psychiatric hospital during a 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes were related to other service use, coercion, medication, adverse events, satisfaction, social functioning, quality of life, and economic factors (cost analysis). Results: There was 98.24% (1119/1139) follow-up at 12 months. Tailored mobile telephone text messages did not reduce the rate of hospital admissions (242/563, 43.0% of the SMS group vs 216/556, 38.8% of the control group; relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.92-1.33; P=.28), time between hospitalizations (mean difference 7.0 days 95% CI –8.0 to 24.0; P=.37), time spent in a psychiatric hospital during the year (mean difference 2.0 days 95% CI –2.0 to 7.0; P=.35), or other service outcomes. People who received text messages were less disabled, based on Global Assessment Scale scores at the time of their readmission, than those who did not receive text messages (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.47-0.97; P=.04). The costs of treatment were higher for people in the SMS group than in the control group (mean €10,103 vs €9210, respectively, P<.001). Conclusions: High-grade routinely collected data can provide clear outcomes for pragmatic randomized trials. SMS messaging tailored with the input of each individual patient did not decrease the rate of psychiatric hospital visits after the 12 months of follow-up. Although there may have been other, more subtle effects, the results of these were not evident in outcomes of agreed importance to clinicians, policymakers, and patients and their families.

Nevertheless, prior studies demonstrating this sex difference in photograph-evaluation contexts have used extremely small samples of stimuli, which is as detrimental to statistical power as the use of small samples of participants. The current registered report used very large samples of both participants (N=1,204) and stimuli photographs (N=593) to test the sex difference in the attractiveness-desire association. The sex difference emerged with objective assessments of attractiveness from independent raters (approximately q = .13, a small effect) but not with participants’ own assessments of attractiveness (q = .00). Various other moderators that have been summoned to explain cross-study variability in prior research received no support (e.g., the sex difference was not larger in serious relationship contexts, the low-to-moderate range of attractiveness, etc.). Surprisingly, in the small sample of participants who were attracted to same-sex individuals, the attractiveness-desire association was stronger for women than men—the opposite of the sex difference anticipated by prior mate preferences research. This study provides effect-size benchmarks for studies of sex differences and highlights the importance of stimulus sampling when documenting replicable effects.",2018,2019-10-31 20:35:16,2019-10-31T20:35:16Z,,,,,In Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feature-based view assumes that object knowledge is grounded in a widely distributed neural network in terms of sensory/function features (e.g., Warrington &amp; Shallice, 1984), while the category-based view assumes in addition that object knowledge is organized by taxonomic and thematic categories (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2011). Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation paradigm, we compared predictions from the feature- and category-based views by examining the neural substrates recruited as subjects read word pairs that were identical, taxonomically related, thematically related or unrelated while controlling for the function features involved across the two categories. We improved upon previous study designs and employed an fMRI adaptation task, obtaining results overall consistent with both the category-based and feature-based views. Consistent with the category-based view, we observed for both hypothesized regions of interest (ROI) and exploratory (whole-brain analyses) reduced activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) for taxonomically related versus unrelated word pairs, and for the exploratory analysis only, reduced activity in the right ATL. In addition, the exploratory analyses revealed reduced activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) for thematically related versus unrelated word pairs. Consistent with the feature-based view, we found in the exploratory analyses that activity reduced in the bilateral precentral gyri (i.e., function regions) including part of premotor cortex as the function relatedness ratings increased. However, we did not find a relationship between adaptation effects in the bilateral ATLs and left TPJ and corresponding ratings of taxonomic/thematic relationships suggesting that the adaptation effects may potentially not reflect aspects of taxonomy that have been traditionally assumed. Together, our findings indicate that both feature and category information are important for the organization of object knowledge although the exact nature of those organization principles is an important question for future research.",2016-02-06,2019-10-31 20:34:57,2019-10-31T20:34:57Z,2017-05-04 21:19:49,174-194,,,78,,Cortex,Role of features and categories in the organization of object knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Features; Taxonomic category; The organization of object knowledge; Thematic category,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unclear if the psychological benefits extend to functionality, i.e., if participants perform their activities better in nature, and how movement is expressed in nature-based and indoor environments, during similar exercise. The present registered report was a randomized controlled trial investigating how engaging in similar resistance-based exercise (calisthenics) in nature-based and indoor settings differed in affective valence, perceived exertion, visual attention, movement adaptability, heart rate variability, and performance. Nature-based exercisers (N = 51) showed increased performance output than indoor exercisers (N = 53) (p < 0.001). There were no group differences in affective valence, perceived exertion, or visual attention. However, psychological states of nature-based exercisers showed stronger associations to performance output (r < 0.33) than those of indoor exercisers (r < 0.03). Nature-based exercisers’ movement variability and structure, measured with non-linear and fractal techniques (Sample Entropy and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis), were more regular (p < 0.001) and more functionally adaptive (long-term Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, p = 0.022) to achieve better performance output. Heart rate variability measures were not different between groups. Distinct environments can influence movement adaptability in a calisthenics exercise routine, and ultimately contribute to better performance. These results show how action is specific to task environment, and how action implies not only the task, but also the characteristics of the environment.

Two recent studies examine whether beliefs in a disease model of addiction influence public stigma but result in equivocal findings – in line with the mixed-blessings model, Kelly et al. (2021) found that whilst the label ‘chronically relapsing brain disease’ reduced blame attribution, it decreased prognostic optimism and increased perceived danger and need for continued care; however, Rundle et al. (2021) conclude absence of evidence. This study isolates the different factors used in these two studies to assess whether health condition (drug use vs. health concern), aetiological label (brain disease vs. problem), and attributional judgement (low vs. high treatment stability) influence public stigma towards problematic substance use. Methods: 1613 participants were assigned randomly to one of eight vignette conditions that manipulated these factors. They completed self-report measures of discrete and general public stigma and an indirect measure of discrimination. Results: Greater social distance, danger, and public stigma but lower blame were ascribed to drug use relative to a health concern. Greater (genetic) blame was reported when drug use was labelled as a ‘chronically relapsing brain disease’ relative to a ‘problem’. Findings for attributional judgement were either inconclusive or statistically equivalent. Discussion: The labels used to describe problematic substance use appear to impact discrete elements of stigma. We suggest that addiction is a functional attribution, which may explain the mixed literature on the impact of aetiological labels on stigma to date.",2023-02-16,2023-05-01 07:01:03,2023-05-01T07:01:03Z,,,,,,,,The labels and models used to describe problematic substance use impact discrete elements of stigma,,,,,,,,,,,,Edge Hill University,,,,,,,addiction; brain disease; discrimination; models of addiction; problematic substance use; stigma; vignettes; ⛔ No DOI found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuroimaging studies report brain structural associations with both pubertal timing and depression. However, whether brain structure mediates the relationship between pubertal timing and depression remains unclear. Methods The current registered report examined associations between pubertal timing (indexed via perceived pubertal development), brain structure (cortical and subcortical metrics, and white matter microstructure) and depressive symptoms in a large sample (N = ~5,000) of adolescents (aged 9-13 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used three waves of follow-up data when the youth were aged 10-11 years, 11-12 years, and 12-13 years, respectively. We used generalised linear-mixed models (H1) and structural equation modelling (H2 & H3) to test our hypotheses. Hypotheses We hypothesised that earlier pubertal timing at Year 1 would be associated with increased depressive symptoms at Year 3 (H1), and that this relationship would be mediated by global (H2a-b) and regional (H3a-g) brain structural measures at Year 2. Global measures included reduced cortical volume, thickness, surface area and sulcal depth. Regional measures included reduced cortical thickness and volume in temporal and fronto-parietal areas, increased cortical volume in the ventral diencephalon, increased sulcal depth in the pars orbitalis, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the cortico-striatal tract and corpus callosum. These regions of interest were informed by our pilot analyses using baseline ABCD data when the youth were aged 9-10 years. Results Earlier pubertal timing was associated with increased depressive symptoms two years later. The magnitude of effect was stronger in female youth and the association remained significant when controlling for parental depression, family income, and BMI in females but not in male youth. Our hypothesised brain structural measures did not however mediate the association between earlier pubertal timing and later depressive symptoms. Conclusion The present results demonstrate that youth, particularly females, who begin puberty ahead of their peers are at an increased risk for adolescent-onset depression. Future work should explore additional biological and socio-environmental factors that may affect this association so that we can identify targets for intervention to help these at-risk youth.",2023-02-24,2023-02-27 20:40:42,2023-02-27T20:40:42Z,2023-02-27 20:40:40,101223,,,,,Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience,The role of brain structure in the association between pubertal timing and depression risk in an early adolescent sample (the ABCD Study®),,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,ABCD Study; adolescent depression; brain structure; pubertal timing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In line with our hypotheses, we found that the scientist was seen as more credible than the spiritual guru. The overall credibility of the statements was positively related to supernatural beliefs. These beliefs also interacted with the source of the statement, which was reflected in a tendency for supernatural believers to rate statements from both the scientist and the guru as credible.

Such cooperation is coordinated between community members via social norms. Developmental research has demonstrated that very young children are sensitive to social norms, and that social norms are internalized by middle childhood. Most research on social norm acquisition has focused on norms that modulated intra-group cooperation. Yet around the world, multi-ethnic communities also cooperate, and this cooperation is often shaped by distinct inter-group social norms. In the present study, we will investigate whether inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic social norm acquisition follows the same, or distinct, developmental trajectories. Specifically, we will work with BaYaka foragers and Bandongo fisher-farmers who inhabit multi-ethnic villages in the Republic of the Congo. In these villages, inter-ethnic cooperation is regulated by sharing norms. Through interviews with adult participants, we will provide the first descriptive account of the timing and mechanism by which BaYaka and Bandongo learn to share with out-group members. Children (5–17 years) and adults (17+ years) will also participate in a modified Dictator Game to investigate the developmental trajectories of children’s intra- and inter-ethnic sharing choices. Based on our ethnographic knowledge of the participating communities, we predict that children’s intra-ethnic sharing choices in the Dictator Game will match those of adults at an earlier age than their inter-ethnic sharing choices.

Environmental action, however, fails to reflect this urgency, leaving social-behavioral research at the frontier of environmental conservation, as well as environmental justice. Broad societal consensus for environmental action is particularly sparse among conservatives. The lack of even small personal sacrifices in favor of the environment could be attributed to the relatively low salience of environmental threats to white Americans and the partisan nature of environmentalism in America. We evaluate if (1) environmental action is causally related to the ideological value framing of an environmental issue; and (2) if the perceived race of impacted communities influences environmental action as a function of racial resentment.

At present the discussion on what to consider when selecting a replication target is limited to theoretical discussion, self-reported justifications and a few formalized suggestions. In this Registered Report, we proposed a study involving the scientific community to create a list of considerations for consultation when selecting a replication target in psychology.

Two correlative survey studies (Study 1 and 2, N = 568) and one registered experimental study (Study 3, N = 500) examined the cognitive mechanisms that are used to derive an answer to this question. We tested whether individuals use their personal income (PI) as a self-generated anchor to derive an estimate of the income needed to be rich (= income wealth threshold estimation, IWTE). On a bivariate level, we found the expected positive relationship between one's PI and IWTE and, in line with previous findings, we found that people do not consider themselves rich. Furthermore, we predicted that individuals additionally use information about their social status within their social circles to make an IWTE. The findings from study 2 support this notion and show that only self-reported high-income individuals show different IWTEs depending on relative social status: Individuals in this group who self-reported a high status produced higher IWTEs than individuals who self-reported low status. The registered experimental study could not replicate this pattern robustly, although the results trended non-significantly in the same direction.

Predicting the position of a moving object requires an estimate of its velocity. When flow parsing during self-motion is incomplete–that is, when some of the retinal motion created by self-motion is incorrectly attributed to object motion–object velocity estimates become biased. Further, the process of flow parsing should add noise and lead to object velocity judgements being more variable during self-motion. Biases and lowered precision in velocity estimation should then translate to biases and lowered precision in motion extrapolation. We investigate this relationship between self-motion, velocity estimation and motion extrapolation with two tasks performed in a realistic virtual reality (VR) environment: first, participants are shown a ball moving laterally which disappears after a certain time. They then indicate by button press when they think the ball would have hit a target rectangle positioned in the environment. While the ball is visible, participants sometimes experience simultaneous visual lateral self-motion in either the same or in the opposite direction of the ball. The second task is a two-interval forced choice task in which participants judge which of two motions is faster: in one interval they see the same ball they observed in the first task while in the other they see a ball cloud whose speed is controlled by a PEST staircase. While observing the single ball, they are again moved visually either in the same or opposite direction as the ball or they remain static. We expect participants to overestimate the speed of a ball that moves opposite to their simulated self-motion (speed estimation task), which should then lead them to underestimate the time it takes the ball to reach the target rectangle (prediction task). Seeing the ball during visually simulated self-motion should increase variability in both tasks. We expect to find performance in both tasks to be correlated, both in accuracy and precision.",2023-01-30,2023-02-24 14:42:55,2023-02-24T14:42:55Z,2023-02-24 14:42:55,e0267983,,1,18,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,,,,Extrapolation; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Motion; Sensory cues; Velocity; Virus testing; Vision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although theoretical models predict that environmental risks shift the cost–benefit trade-off associated with social information use, this idea has received little empirical support. Here we aim to test the effect of childhood environmental adversity on humans' susceptibility to follow others’ opinion in the context of a standard face evaluation task. Results collected in a pilot study involving 121 adult participants tested online showed that susceptibility to social influence and childhood environmental adversity are positively associated. Computational analyses further confirmed that this effect is not explained by the fact that participants exposed to early adversity produce noisier decisions overall but that they are indeed more likely to follow the group's opinion. To test the robustness of these findings, a pre-registered direct replication using an optimal sample size was run. The results obtained from 262 participants in the pre-registered study did not reveal a significant association between childhood adversity and task performance but the meta-analysis ran on both the pilot and the pre-registered study replicated the initial finding.

The full potential of digital interventions is hindered by a lack of user engagement. There is an urgent need to develop effective strategies that can promote users&#8217; engagement with digital interventions. One potential method is the use of technology-based reminders or prompts. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based strategies for promoting engagement with digital interventions. Methods: Cochrane Collaboration guidelines on systematic review methodology were followed. The search strategy was executed across 7 electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Databases were searched from inception to September 13, 2013, with no language or publication type restrictions, using three concepts: randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, and engagement. Gray literature and reference lists of included studies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by 2 authors, then the full texts of potentially eligible papers were obtained and double-screened. Data from eligible papers were extracted by one author and checked for accuracy by another author. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Narrative synthesis was performed on all included studies and, where appropriate, data were pooled using meta-analysis. All findings were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 14 studies were included in the review with 8774 participants. Of the 14 studies, 9 had sufficient data to be included in the meta-analyses. The meta-analyses suggested that technology-based strategies can potentially promote engagement compared to no strategy for dichotomous outcomes (relative risk [RR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60, I 2 =71%), but due to considerable heterogeneity and the small sample sizes in most studies, this result should be treated with caution. No studies reported adverse or economic outcomes. Only one study with a small sample size compared different characteristics; the study found that strategies promoting new digital intervention content and those sent to users shortly after they started using the digital intervention were more likely to engage users. Conclusions: Overall, studies reported borderline positive effects of technology-based strategies on engagement compared to no strategy. However, the results have to be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to replicate findings and understand which characteristics of the strategies are effective in promoting engagement and how cost-effective they are.

With most youth using the internet, electronic health (eHealth) interventions are promising tools for reaching this population. Through participatory design research (PDR) engagement methods, Thought Spot, a Web- and mobile-based platform, was redeveloped to facilitate access to mental health services by transition-aged youth (aged 16-29 years) in postsecondary settings. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the process of engaging with postsecondary students through the PDR approaches, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the Thought Spot platform. Methods: Consistent with the PDR approaches, five student-led workshops, attended by 41 individuals, were facilitated to obtain feedback regarding the platform’s usability and functionality and its potential value in a postsecondary setting. Various creative engagement activities were delivered to gather experiences and opinions, including semistructured focus groups, questionnaires, personas, journey mapping, and a world café. Innovative technological features and refinements were also brainstormed during the workshops. Results: By using PDR methods of engagement, participants knew that their ideas and recommendations would be applied. There was also an overall sense of respect and care integrated into each group, which facilitated an exchange of ideas and suggestions. Conclusions: The process of engaging with students to redesign the Thought Spot platform through PDR has been effective. Findings from these workshops will significantly inform new technological features within the app to enable positive help-seeking behaviors among students. These behaviors will be further explored in the second phase that involves a randomized controlled trial.

The underrepresentation of minorities in trials limits the external validity of the findings for this key patient demographic. Objective: This systematic review examines (1) the research reporting practices and prevalence of ethnic minority patients included in telehealth randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting type 2 diabetes and the trial characteristics associated with recruiting a high proportion of minority patients, and (2) the proportion of included RCTs that report using English language proficiency as a patient screening criterion and how and why they do so. Methods: Telehealth RCTs published in refereed journals targeting type 2 diabetes as a primary condition for adults in Western majority English-speaking countries were included. Ethnically targeted RCTs were excluded from the main review, but were included in a post hoc subgroup analysis. Abstract and full-text screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Results: Of 3358 records identified in the search, 79 articles comprising 58 RCTs were included. Nearly two-thirds of the RCTs (38/58) reported on the ethnic composition of participants, with a median proportion of 23.5% patients (range 0%-97.7%). Fourteen studies (24%) that included at least 30% minority patients were all US-based, predominantly recruited from urban areas, and described the target population as underserved, financially deprived, or uninsured. Eight of these 14 studies (57%) offered intervention materials in a language other than English or employed bilingual staff. Half of all identified RCTs (29/58) included language proficiency as a participant-screening criterion. Language proficiency was operationalized using nonstandardized measures (eg, having sufficient “verbal fluency”), with only three studies providing reasons for excluding patients on language grounds. Conclusions: There was considerable variability across studies in the inclusion of ethnic minority patients in RCTs, with higher participation rates in countries with legislation to mandate their inclusion (eg, United States) than in those without such legislation (eg, United Kingdom). Less than 25% of the RCTs recruited a sizeable proportion of ethnic minorities, which raises concerns about external validity. The lack of objective measures or common procedures for assessing language proficiency across trials implies that language-related eligibility decisions are often based on trial recruiters’ impressionistic judgments, which could be subject to bias. The variability and inconsistent reporting on ethnicity and other socioeconomic factors in descriptions of research participants could be more specifically emphasized in trial reporting guidelines to promote best practice.

However, obtaining patients’ perspectives is challenging. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has gained popularity over the past decade as a crowdsourcing platform to reach large numbers of individuals to perform tasks for a small reward for the respondent, at small cost to the investigator. The appropriateness of such crowdsourcing methods in medical research has yet to be clarified. Objective: The goals of this study were to (1) understand how those on MTurk who screen positive for back pain prioritize research topics compared with those who screen negative for back pain, and (2) determine the qualitative differences in open-ended comments between groups. Methods: We conducted cross-sectional surveys on MTurk to assess participants’ back pain and allow them to prioritize research topics. We paid respondents US $0.10 to complete the 24-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) to categorize participants as those “with back pain” and those “without back pain,” then offered both those with (RMDQ score ≥7) and those without back pain (RMDQ <7) an opportunity to rank their top 5 (of 18) research topics for an additional US $0.75. We compared demographic information and research priorities between the 2 groups and performed qualitative analyses on free-text commentary that participants provided. Results: We conducted 2 screening waves. We first screened 2189 individuals for back pain over 33 days and invited 480 (21.93%) who screened positive to complete the prioritization, of whom 350 (72.9% of eligible) did. We later screened 664 individuals over 7 days and invited 474 (71.4%) without back pain to complete the prioritization, of whom 397 (83.7% of eligible) did. Those with back pain who prioritized were comparable with those without in terms of age, education, marital status, and employment. The group with back pain had a higher proportion of women (234, 67.2% vs 229, 57.8%, P=.02). The groups’ rank lists of research priorities were highly correlated: Spearman correlation coefficient was .88 when considering topics ranked in the top 5. The 2 groups agreed on 4 of the top 5 and 9 of the top 10 research priorities. Conclusions: Crowdsourcing platforms such as MTurk support efforts to efficiently reach large groups of individuals to obtain input on research activities. In the context of back pain, a prevalent and easily understood condition, the rank list of those with back pain was highly correlated with that of those without back pain. However, subtle differences in the content and quality of free-text comments suggest supplemental efforts may be needed to augment the reach of crowdsourcing in obtaining perspectives from patients, especially from specific populations.

Identifying ways to enhance mathematical instruction is crucial to understanding the ideal ways to promote academic success. Previous work has identified mathematical language (i.e., the words and concepts related to early mathematical development such as more, same, or similar) as a key mechanism that can be targeted to improve children’s development of early numeracy skills (e.g., counting, cardinality, and addition). Current recommendations suggest a combination of numeracy instruction and quantitative language instruction to promote numeracy skills. However, there is limited direct support of this recommendation. The goal of the proposed study is to compare the unique and combined effects of each type of instruction on children’s numeracy skills in the context of picture book reading. We randomly assigned 234 children (ages 3–5) to one of four conditions where they worked with trained project staff who read picture books targeting: (a) quantitative language only (e.g., more or less), (b) numeracy only (e.g., cardinality, addition), (c) combined [quantitative language + numeracy], or (d) nonnumerical (active control) picture books. Results revealed no significant effects of the quantitative language only or numeracy only conditions, but mixed effects of the combined condition. These findings indicate that more work is needed on how mathematical language and numeracy instruction should best be delivered to preschool children.

Preliminary correlational evidence suggests that successfully down-regulating negative affect is associated with lower motivation to engage in political action, although experimental studies could not find such negative impact. We hypothesized that reappraisal may impact threat mitigation behavior differently, depending on its implementation: If individuals implement reappraisal to down-regulate their negative affect in response to a threatening situation, they neutralize the mobilizing effect of negative affect in threat mitigation, resulting in less engagement in threat mitigation behavior. However, if individuals reframe one's barriers to act, they should engage more strongly in such behavior. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an online experiment (N = 693) where participants read about threats to biodiversity before being instructed to reappraise these threats with a focus on either emotions or barriers and then engaged in a consequential biodiversity conservation task. This manipulation did not significantly impact threat mitigation intentions nor actual behavior. However, we found correlational evidence for differential associations: Reappraising one's negative affect more successfully was significantly associated with less engagement in threat mitigation behavior, while reappraising one's barriers more successfully was associated with more engagement in threat mitigation behavior.",2023-07-01,2023-05-22 13:11:59,2023-05-22T13:11:59Z,2023-05-22 13:11:58,104475,,,107,,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Too much praise for reappraisal?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Affect; Emotion; Emotion regulation; Environmental psychology; Reappraisal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov’s original analysis strategy, the valence–dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence–dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.",2021-01,2023-02-24 21:28:58,2023-02-24T21:28:58Z,2023-02-24 21:28:58,159-169,,1,5,,Nat Hum Behav,,,,,,,,en,"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,,,,Human behaviour; Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

V6MGV6TY,journalArticle,2017,"Blijleven, Vincent; Koelemeijer, Kitty; Wetzels, Marijntje; Jaspers, Monique","Workarounds Emerging From Electronic Health Record System Usage: Consequences for Patient Safety, Effectiveness of Care, and Efficiency of Care",JMIR Human Factors,,,10/gb23z5,https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2017/4/e27/,"Background: Health care providers resort to informal temporary practices known as workarounds for handling exceptions to normal workflow unintendedly imposed by electronic health record systems (EHRs). Although workarounds may seem favorable at first sight, they are generally suboptimal and may jeopardize patient safety, effectiveness of care, and efficiency of care. Objective: Research into the scope and impact of EHR workarounds on patient care processes is scarce. This paper provides insight into the effects of EHR workarounds on organizational workflows and outcomes of care services by identifying EHR workarounds and determining their rationales, scope, and impact on health care providers’ workflows, patient safety, effectiveness of care, and efficiency of care. Knowing the rationale of a workaround provides valuable clues about the source of origin of each workaround and how each workaround could most effectively be resolved. Knowing the scope and impact a workaround has on EHR-related safety, effectiveness, and efficiency provides insight into how to address related concerns. Methods: Direct observations and follow-up semistructured interviews with 31 physicians, 13 nurses, and 3 clerks and qualitative bottom-up coding techniques was used to identify, analyze, and classify EHR workarounds. The research was conducted within 3 specialties and settings at a large university hospital. Rationales were associated with work system components (persons, technology and tools, tasks, organization, and physical environment) of the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework to reveal their source of origin as well as to determine the scope and the impact of each EHR workaround from a structure-process-outcome perspective. Results: A total of 15 rationales for EHR workarounds were identified of which 5 were associated with persons, 4 with technology and tools, 4 with the organization, and 2 with the tasks. Three of these 15 rationales for EHR workarounds have not been identified in prior research: data migration policy, enforced data entry, and task interference. Conclusions: EHR workaround rationales associated with different SEIPS work system components demand a different approach to be resolved. Persons-related workarounds may most effectively be resolved through personal training, organization-related workarounds through reviewing organizational policy and regulations, tasks-related workarounds through process redesign, and technology- and tools-related workarounds through EHR redesign efforts. Furthermore, insights gained from knowing a workaround’s degree of influence as well as impact on patient safety, effectiveness of care, and efficiency of care can inform design and redesign of EHRs to further align EHR design with work contexts, subsequently leading to better organization and (safe) provision of care. In doing so, a research team in collaboration with all stakeholders could use the SEIPS framework to reflect on the current and potential future configurations of the work system to prevent unfavorable workarounds from occurring and how a redesign of the EHR would impact interactions between the work system components.

The rapid rise in their use has created the need for a systematic synthesis of the evidence of their impact as knowledge translation (KT) tools in the health care sector and for an inventory of the factors that affect their use. Objective: Through the Levac six-stage methodology, a scoping review was undertaken to explore the depth and breadth of evidence about the effective, safe, and ethical use of wikis and collaborative writing applications (CWAs) in health care. Methods: Multiple strategies were used to locate studies. Seven scientific databases and 6 grey literature sources were queried for articles on wikis and CWAs published between 2001 and September 16, 2011. In total, 4436 citations and 1921 grey literature items were screened. Two reviewers independently reviewed citations, selected eligible studies, and extracted data using a standardized form. We included any paper presenting qualitative or quantitative empirical evidence concerning health care and CWAs. We defined a CWA as any technology that enables the joint and simultaneous editing of a webpage or an online document by many end users. We performed qualitative content analysis to identify the factors that affect the use of CWAs using the Gagnon framework and their effects on health care using the Donabedian framework. Results: Of the 111 studies included, 4 were experimental, 5 quasi-experimental, 5 observational, 52 case studies, 23 surveys about wiki use, and 22 descriptive studies about the quality of information in wikis. We classified them by theme: patterns of use of CWAs (n=26), quality of information in existing CWAs (n=25), and CWAs as KT tools (n=73). A high prevalence of CWA use (ie, more than 50%) is reported in 58% (7/12) of surveys conducted with health care professionals and students. However, we found only one longitudinal study showing that CWA use is increasing in health care. Moreover, contribution rates remain low and the quality of information contained in different CWAs needs improvement. We identified 48 barriers and 91 facilitators in 4 major themes (factors related to the CWA, users&#8217; knowledge and attitude towards CWAs, human environment, and organizational environment). We also found 57 positive and 23 negative effects that we classified into processes and outcomes. Conclusions: Although we found some experimental and quasi-experimental studies of the effectiveness and safety of CWAs as educational and KT interventions, the vast majority of included studies were observational case studies about CWAs being used by health professionals and patients. More primary research is needed to find ways to address the different barriers to their use and to make these applications more useful for different stakeholders.

Bridging research on social cognition and deception detection, we hypothesized that observing a liar compared to a truth-teller would decrease finger skin temperature of observers. Participants first watched two targets while not forewarned that they would later be asked to judge (direct and indirect) veracity, and then watched another two targets while forewarned about this. During both these phases finger skin temperature was measured. Findings pertaining to temperature partly confirmed our main hypothesis. When participants were observing a liar, irrespective of being forewarned, on average finger skin temperature declined over time. In the forewarned phase, temperature trajectories of truth-tellers were higher than those of liars, however, in the not forewarned phase, this pattern was reversed. Results confirmed our further hypotheses that participants judge liars as less likeable and less trustworthy than truth-tellers—an indication of indirect deception detection. Our hypothesis that the effect size for trustworthiness would be bigger than that of liking was not supported by the data. Additionally, and also confirming our hypothesis, participants performed around chance level when directly judging whether the target person was lying. Exploratory analyses are reported with regard to truth bias and dependency between direct and indirect veracity judgments. Limitations and directions for future work related to the existence of psychophysiological indicators of deception detection are discussed.",2015-06-08,2019-10-31 20:34:58,2019-10-31T20:34:58Z,2016-08-31 17:04:07,672,,,,,Front.

A large sample of British adolescent participants (n = 1004) aged 14 and 15 years and an equal number of their carers were interviewed. Young people provided reports of their recent gaming experiences. Further, the violent contents of these games were coded using official EU and US ratings, and carers provided evaluations of their adolescents' aggressive behaviours in the past month. Following a preregistered analysis plan, multiple regression analyses tested the hypothesis that recent violent game play is linearly and positively related to carer assessments of aggressive behaviour. Results did not support this prediction, nor did they support the idea that the relationship between these factors follows a nonlinear parabolic function. There was no evidence for a critical tipping point relating violent game engagement to aggressive behaviour. Sensitivity and exploratory analyses indicated these null effects extended across multiple operationalizations of violent game engagement and when the focus was on another behavioural outcome, namely, prosocial behaviour. The discussion presents an interpretation of this pattern of effects in terms of both the ongoing scientific and policy debates around violent video games, and emerging standards for robust evidence-based policy concerning young people's technology use.",2019,2019-02-22 13:24:04,2019-02-22T13:24:04Z,2019-02-13 13:51:58,171474,,2,6,,Royal Society Open Science,Violent video game engagement is not associated with adolescents' aggressive behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon),,00000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
