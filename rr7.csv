As a result, there is currently limited evidence that prediction is a viable learning mechanism in infancy. This study targets the role of prediction in early word encoding to assess the viability of such a learning mechanism. To achieve this, we have adapted an adult EEG study focusing on syllabic prediction (Vidal et al., 2019) for an infant population. Our study starts with a learning phase, in which 39 nine-month-old infants hear two trisyllabic pseudowords. These words are then used as standard stimuli in an oddball-phase with four new words. Two of these deviant words only share their first syllable with a familiar word while the other two share their first two syllables. We will measure whether infants’ mismatch-response (MMR) differs between standard and deviant words, to address whether 9-month-olds make phonemic-level predictions. We willalso assess the MMR-difference between the two kinds of deviants. An MMR difference after one versus two shared syllables would suggest that cumulative congruent input reinforces prediction. As infants’ MMR can vary, we will also carry out a second task to localize the individual MMR responses of each participant in the form of a tone-change-detection Optimum-1 task. This task will determine the location, latency and polarity of the MMR for each infant separately, and will ensure that the study has sufficient statistical power.","2024-01-10","2024-04-06 02:29:41","2024-04-06T02:29:41Z","2024-04-05 14:42:01","","","","","","","The babe with the predictive power","","","","","","","en-uk","","Other","","","","","Citation Key: Fazekas-2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vivo research has unique characteristics not shared with clinical research, meaning approaches to systematic review must be adapted to this context. We aim to evaluate the quantity, characteristics, and transparent reporting in systematic reviews which synthesise research using genetically-modified animals to model NDCs.  Methods: On 23 January 2023, we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science Core Collection to identify systematic reviews synthesising research using genetically-modified animals to model NDCs where the modified gene is one of a list of 102 genes associated with NDCs identified through large-scale exome sequencing, or FMR1, MECP2, or UBE3A. Two independent reviewers screened studies based on full text and extracted data from included reviews. We assessed the reporting quality of each included review using an adapted version of the PRISMA checklist (PRISMA-Pre).   Results: Twelve reviews met our criteria. We found mixed levels of reporting, with some items such as identifying the publication as a systematic review in the title, search strategies, and funding sources being well reported, and others such as protocol registration and data sharing less well reported. We also identified 19 review registrations via PROSPERO, most of which remain unpublished after their anticipated end dates.

Different concepts to determine the rate of displacement (Vc) from the maximum twitch exist, but information on their reproducibility is scarce. Further, different inter-stimuli intervals during progressive stimulation are used, but the effect of different intervals on Vc is unclear. Objectives The first aim of this study was to investigate the within and between-day reliability of the five most frequently used Vc concepts. The second aim was to investigate the effect of different inter-stimuli intervals on Vc. Methods On two consecutive days, we determined Vc of the biceps femoris long head and rectus femoris of twenty-four healthy subjects. The maximum displacement was determined twice within three minutes on day one and a third time 24 h later. Also, on day two, we applied three blocks of ten consecutive stimuli at a constant intensity of 50 mA, separated by 3 min each. Inter-stimuli intervals in randomly ordered blocks were 10 s, 20 s or 30 s, respectively. Results All Vc concepts displayed good to excellent relative (ICC 0.87–0.99) and generally good absolute within- and between-day reliability for both muscles. Across Vc-concepts, absolute reliability was higher for the rectus femoris (CV% 1.3–7.95%) compared to the biceps femoris (CV% 6.06–15.30%). In both muscles, Vc was generally not affected by different inter-stimuli intervals. For most Vc concepts, repeated stimulation induced an increase regardless of the inter-stimuli interval, but this effect was mainly trivial and small at most. Conclusions The reproducibility of Vc concepts was generally good but varies between different muscles. A rest interval of 10 s seems preferable to longer intervals for less time required per measurement. Following this initial study, the effect of different inter-stimuli intervals on Vc should be further investigated.","2023-08-02","2023-08-22 14:43:42","2023-08-22T14:43:42Z","2023-08-21 13:55:23","e0288806","","8","18","","PLOS ONE","Reproducibility of knee extensor and flexor contraction velocity in healthy men and women assessed using tensiomyography","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science Citation Key: langenReproducibilityKneeExtensor2023","","","","","Fatigue; Functional electrical stimulation; Muscle analysis; Muscle contraction; Physical activity; Research validity; Skeletal muscles; Time measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike quantified sentences (e.g., “Many  Germans are efficient”), generics are very unspecific about how prevalent a property is in a group. This  talk reviews puzzling findings on their acceptance conditions and perceived implications. For example,  generics are often accepted at surprisingly low prevalence levels and are highly resistant to  counterexamples. This makes generics an ideal vehicle to transmit stereotypes. We therefore present  a study that aims to uncover the puzzling acceptance conditions of generic sentences. To this aim, we  will manipulate sentence type (generic or quantified), absolute prevalence (high, intermediate, low),  relative prevalence (positive, equal, negative), and property type (physical, biological-behavioral,  cultural-behavioral). On each trial, participants will see a contingency table showing the prevalence  levels of a specific property in two alien groups living on a faraway planet. Participants will judge the  acceptability of a sentence prescribing the property to one of the alien groups. One group of  participants will judge the acceptability of quantified sentences and the other group will judge the  acceptability of generic sentences. The acceptability of the quantified sentences is hypothesized to  depend on absolute prevalence, while the acceptability of generic sentences is hypothesized to depend  on relative prevalence. The study is meant to be submitted as a registered report. Therefore, we will  also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of registered reports and will strongly welcome  questions and comments.","2023-05-26","2023-08-22 14:43:31","2023-08-22T14:43:31Z","2023-08-21 14:21:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","lirias.kuleuven.be","","Citation Key: hermansCausalInfluenceAbsolute2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","76th Annual Meeting Belgian Association for Psychological Sciences, Date: 2023/05/26 - 2023/05/26, Location: University of Mons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may be particularly salient in youth who face concurrent challenges such as establishing autonomy and making vocational choices. Objective: The aim of the study was to estimate stigma prevalence in youth (aged 14-24 years) with type 1 diabetes and its associations with glycemic control. Methods: Participants, recruited largely through social media, were asked to complete a Web-based survey and to send via mail capillary blood samples for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement. The primary definition of stigma required endorsement of one or more of 3 stigma-specific items of the Barriers to Diabetes Adherence questionnaire. These addressed avoidance of diabetes management with friends present, difficulty telling others about diabetes diagnosis, and embarrassment in performing diabetes care with others present. Poor glycemic control was defined as HbA1c>9% (ie, >75 mmol/mol; measured value when available, else self-report) and/or ≥1 severe hypoglycemic episode in the previous year (reported requiring assistance from someone else during the episode). Stigma prevalence was computed (95% CI), and associations with glycemic control were evaluated (multivariate logistic regression models). Results: Among the 380 respondents, stigma prevalence was 65.5% (95% CI 60.7-70.3). Stigma was associated with a 2-fold higher odds of poor glycemic control overall (odds ratio [OR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.33-3.80; adjusted for age, sex, and type of treatment). There were specific associations with both HbA1c>9% (75 mmol/mol; OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.36-6.86) and severe hypoglycemia in the previous year (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.05-3.31). Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of stigma in youth with type 1 diabetes that is associated with both elevated HbA1c levels and severe hypoglycemia. Targeted strategies to address stigma are needed.

Currently, there is scarce evidence in support of a noradrenergic mechanism of taVNS and limited knowledge on its stimulation parameters (i.e., intensity and pulse width). Therefore, the present study aimed to test whether taVNS enhances pupil dilation, a noradrenergic biomarker, as a function of stimulation parameters. Forty-nine participants received sham (i.e., left ear earlobe) and taVNS (i.e., left ear cymba concha) stimulation in two separate sessions, in a counterbalanced order. We administered short bursts (5s) of seven stimulation settings varying as a function of pulse width and intensity and measured pupil size in parallel. Each stimulation setting was administered sixteen times in separate blocks. We expected short bursts of stimulation to elicit phasic noradrenergic activity as indexed by event-related pupil dilation and event-related temporal derivative. We hypothesised higher stimulation settings, quantified as the total charge per pulse (pulse width x intensity), to drive greater event-related pupil dilation and temporal derivative in the taVNS compared to sham condition. Specifically, we expected stimulation settings in the taVNS condition to be associated with a linear increase in event-related pupil dilation and temporal derivative. We found stimulation settings to linearly increase both pupil measures. In line with our hypothesis, the observed dose-dependent effect was stronger in the taVNS condition. We also found taVNS to elicit more intense and unpleasant sensations than sham stimulation. These results support the hypothesis of a noradrenergic mechanism of taVNS. However, future studies should disentangle whether stimulation elicited sensations mediate the effect of taVNS on evoked pupil dilation.","2023-02-01","2023-06-13 16:13:25","2023-06-13T16:13:25Z","2023-02-24 16:43:44","233-253","","","159","","Cortex","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","life science","Noradrenaline; Norepinephrine; Pupil dilation; Stimulation parameters; taVNS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is most prominent during top-down, or endogenous, attention, and nearly absent in bottom-up, or exogenous orienting. These changes are highly lateralised, such that an increase in alpha power is seen ipsilateral to the attended region of space and a decrease is seen contralaterally. Whether these changes in alpha oscillatory activity are causally related to attentional resources, or to perceptual processes, or are simply epiphenomenal, is unknown. If alpha oscillations are indicative of a causal mechanism whereby attention is allocated to a region of space, it remains an open question as to whether this is driven by ipsilateral increases or contralateral decreases in alpha power. This preregistered report set out to test these questions. To do so, we used transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) to modulate alpha activity in the somatosensory cortex whilst measuring performance on established tactile attention paradigms. All participants completed an endogenous and exogenous tactile attention task in three stimulation conditions; alpha, sham and beta. Sham and beta stimulation operated as controls so that any observed effects could be attributed to alpha stimulation specifically. We replicated previous behavioural findings in all stimulation conditions showing a facilitation of cued trials in the endogenous task, and inhibition of return in the exogenous task. However, these were not affected by stimulation manipulations. Using Bayes-factor analysis we show strong support for the null hypotheses – that the manipulation of Alpha by tACS does not cause changes in tactile spatial attention. This well-powered study, conducted over three separate days, is an important contribution to the current debate regarding the efficiency of brain stimulation.","2023-03-30","2023-05-01 07:00:02","2023-05-01T07:00:02Z","2023-04-14 17:01:46","","","","","","","Spatial attention is not affected by alpha or beta transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation","","","","","","","en","cc_by_nc_nd_4","","","","openaccess.city.ac.uk","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.","2022-11-18","2023-02-24 21:40:02","2023-02-24T21:40:02Z","2023-02-24 21:40:02","","","","","","","Stage 1 Registered Report","","","","","F1000Research","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","f1000research.com","","DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.125649.2 Type: article","","","","","affective neuroscience; laboratory animal welfare; playful handling; positive animal welfare; protocol; rat tickling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11:1053","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Greene et al.

Our knowledge is limited concerning both the universality of these effects outside the United States and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters, replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters, suggesting it is culturally universal. The evidence for the cultural universality of the interaction effect was inconclusive in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters (depending on exclusion criteria).

The technique used for eliciting an effect is the ganzfeld condition (a form of sensory homogenization that eliminates distracting peripheral noise). The database consists of studies published between January 1974 and December 2020 inclusive. The overall effect size estimated both with a frequentist and a Bayesian random-effect model, were in close agreement yielding an effect size of .099 (.05-.14). This result passed four publication bias tests and seems not contaminated by questionable research practices. Trend analysis carried out with a cumulative meta-analysis and a meta-regression model with Year of publication as covariate did not indicate a sign of the decline of this effect size. The moderators' analyses show that selected participants' outcomes were almost three times those obtained by non-selected participants and that tasks that simulate telepathic communication show a two-fold effect size with respect to tasks requiring the participants to guess a target.

This study tested whether table or text-only formats lead to better comprehension of the potential harms and benefits of different options, here in a medical context. Design: pre-registered, longitudinal experiment: between-subjects factorial 2 (message format) × 2 topic (therapeutic or preventative intervention) on comprehension and later recall (CONSORT-SPI 2018). Setting: longitudinal online survey experiment. Participants: 2305 census-matched UK residents recruited through the survey panel firm YouGov. Primary outcome measure: comprehension of harms and benefits and knowledge recall after six weeks. Results: fact boxes—simple tabular messages—led to more comprehension (d = 0.39) and slightly more knowledge recall after six weeks (d = 0.12) compared to the same information in text. These patterns of results were consistent between the two medical topics and across all levels of objective numeracy and education. Fact boxes were rated as more engaging than text, and there were no differences between formats in treatment decisions, feeling informed or trust. Conclusions: the brief table format of the fact box improved the comprehension of harms and benefits relative to the text-only control. Effective communication supports informed consent and decision-making and brings ethical and practical advantages. Fact boxes and other summary formats may be effective in a wide range of communication contexts.","","2021-03-10 09:59:26","2021-03-10T09:59:26Z","2021-03-03 15:00:26","190876","","3","7","","Royal Society Open Science","Risk communication in tables versus text","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00009  Publisher: Royal Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1977, Amos Tversky published a highly influential feature-based model of how people judge the similarity between objects. The model highlights the context-dependence of similarity judgments, and challenged geometric models of similarity. One of the context-dependent effects Tversky describes is the diagnosticity principle. The diagnosticity principle determines which features are used to cluster multiple objects into subgroups. Perceived similarity between items within clusters is expected to increase, while similarity between items in different clusters decreases. Here, we present two pre-registered replications of the studies on the diagnosticity effect reported in Tversky (1977). Additionally, one alternative mechanism that has been proposed to play a role in the original studies, an increase in the choice for distractor items (a substitution effect, see Medin et al., 1995), is examined. Our results replicate those found by Tversky (1977), revealing an average diagnosticity-effect of 4.75%. However, when we eliminate the possibility of substitution effects confounding the results, a meta-analysis of the data provides no indication of any remaining effect of diagnosticity.","2014","2021-01-06 14:42:08","2021-01-06T14:42:08Z","2016-08-31 16:58:55","875","","","5","","Front.

The present article explores the validity of such an implicit measure by proposing several extensions and adaptions. We addressed methodological problems of a me/not-me response latency task developed in this literature by proposing changes in material, calculation of indices and implemented the task in an online environment. We also addressed earlier problems with statistical power and proposed a more powerful way of statistical analyses using mixed models. The me/not-me task is based on the idea that higher overlap between self and other traits results in faster response times of characterizing such a trait as descriptive of the self. This relationship should be observed for close others but not for non-close others. In a sample of 339 U.S American adults, we experimentally manipulated the nature of the target (close vs. distant) and participants engaged in the adapted me/not-me paradigm. Results indicated that trait match had a stronger negative effect on response times for participants in the close condition. The effect was also stronger for participants rating the target higher on the IOS self-report scale. We also provided convergent validity of the me/not-me procedure with other constructs ostensibly measuring interpersonal closeness.

Robust research on the impact of mobile technology interventions for these patients remains scarce. Objective: The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of individually tailored short text messages on the rate of psychiatric hospital readmissions, health care service use, and clinical outcomes. In addition, we analyzed treatment costs. Methods: Between September 2011 and November 2012, we randomly assigned 1139 people to a tailored text message intervention (n=569) or usual care (n=570). Participants received semiautomated text messages for up to 12 months or usual care. The primary outcome, based on routinely collected health register data, was patient readmission into a psychiatric hospital during a 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes were related to other service use, coercion, medication, adverse events, satisfaction, social functioning, quality of life, and economic factors (cost analysis). Results: There was 98.24% (1119/1139) follow-up at 12 months. Tailored mobile telephone text messages did not reduce the rate of hospital admissions (242/563, 43.0% of the SMS group vs 216/556, 38.8% of the control group; relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.92-1.33; P=.28), time between hospitalizations (mean difference 7.0 days 95% CI –8.0 to 24.0; P=.37), time spent in a psychiatric hospital during the year (mean difference 2.0 days 95% CI –2.0 to 7.0; P=.35), or other service outcomes. People who received text messages were less disabled, based on Global Assessment Scale scores at the time of their readmission, than those who did not receive text messages (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.47-0.97; P=.04). The costs of treatment were higher for people in the SMS group than in the control group (mean €10,103 vs €9210, respectively, P<.001). Conclusions: High-grade routinely collected data can provide clear outcomes for pragmatic randomized trials. SMS messaging tailored with the input of each individual patient did not decrease the rate of psychiatric hospital visits after the 12 months of follow-up. Although there may have been other, more subtle effects, the results of these were not evident in outcomes of agreed importance to clinicians, policymakers, and patients and their families.

Nevertheless, prior studies demonstrating this sex difference in photograph-evaluation contexts have used extremely small samples of stimuli, which is as detrimental to statistical power as the use of small samples of participants. The current registered report used very large samples of both participants (N=1,204) and stimuli photographs (N=593) to test the sex difference in the attractiveness-desire association. The sex difference emerged with objective assessments of attractiveness from independent raters (approximately q = .13, a small effect) but not with participants’ own assessments of attractiveness (q = .00). Various other moderators that have been summoned to explain cross-study variability in prior research received no support (e.g., the sex difference was not larger in serious relationship contexts, the low-to-moderate range of attractiveness, etc.). Surprisingly, in the small sample of participants who were attracted to same-sex individuals, the attractiveness-desire association was stronger for women than men—the opposite of the sex difference anticipated by prior mate preferences research. This study provides effect-size benchmarks for studies of sex differences and highlights the importance of stimulus sampling when documenting replicable effects.","2018","2019-10-31 20:35:16","2019-10-31T20:35:16Z","","","","","In Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The feature-based view assumes that object knowledge is grounded in a widely distributed neural network in terms of sensory/function features (e.g., Warrington &amp; Shallice, 1984), while the category-based view assumes in addition that object knowledge is organized by taxonomic and thematic categories (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2011). Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation paradigm, we compared predictions from the feature- and category-based views by examining the neural substrates recruited as subjects read word pairs that were identical, taxonomically related, thematically related or unrelated while controlling for the function features involved across the two categories. We improved upon previous study designs and employed an fMRI adaptation task, obtaining results overall consistent with both the category-based and feature-based views. Consistent with the category-based view, we observed for both hypothesized regions of interest (ROI) and exploratory (whole-brain analyses) reduced activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) for taxonomically related versus unrelated word pairs, and for the exploratory analysis only, reduced activity in the right ATL. In addition, the exploratory analyses revealed reduced activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) for thematically related versus unrelated word pairs. Consistent with the feature-based view, we found in the exploratory analyses that activity reduced in the bilateral precentral gyri (i.e., function regions) including part of premotor cortex as the function relatedness ratings increased. However, we did not find a relationship between adaptation effects in the bilateral ATLs and left TPJ and corresponding ratings of taxonomic/thematic relationships suggesting that the adaptation effects may potentially not reflect aspects of taxonomy that have been traditionally assumed. Together, our findings indicate that both feature and category information are important for the organization of object knowledge although the exact nature of those organization principles is an important question for future research.","2016-02-06","2019-10-31 20:34:57","2019-10-31T20:34:57Z","2017-05-04 21:19:49","174-194","","","78","","Cortex","Role of features and categories in the organization of object knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Features; Taxonomic category; The organization of object knowledge; Thematic category","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
