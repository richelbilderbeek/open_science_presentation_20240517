 * [Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/5aSclKRIO)

Writing down and publishing the analysis of a study before having seen the data
is a recommended Open Science practice called pre-registration.
This practice will, among others, prevent the authors of the scientific paper
to make up story that fit the data well.
However, while this practice is suitable for hypothesis-driven research,
it's suitability is doubted for exploratory studies.
This talk presents the results from a literature search and other findings
to answer the question 'How suitable is a pre-registration in exploratory studies?'.
