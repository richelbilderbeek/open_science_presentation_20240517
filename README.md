 * Title: On publishing the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data
 * [Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/5aSclKRIO)

Writing down and publishing the analysis of a study before having seen the data
is a recommended Open Science practice called pre-registration.
This practice will, among others, prevent the authors of the scientific paper
to make up story that fit the data well.
However, while this practice is suitable for hypothesis-driven research,
it's suitability is doubted for exploratory studies.
This talk presents the results from a literature search and other findings
to answer the question 'How suitable is a pre-registration in exploratory studies?'.


## Draft of talk

Types:

- Preregistration is the practice of registering the hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses of a scientific study before it is conducted.[1][2] 
- Clinical trial registration is similar, although it may not require the registration of a study's analysis protocol. 
- registered reports include the peer review and in principle acceptance of a study protocol prior to data collection.[3] 




'I will argue that only slight modifications are needed to harness the potential of preregistration and make exploratory research more trustworthy and useful.' [`dirnagl2020preregistration`]

'Through the log, reviewers could monitor the work as it unfolds, a “rolling review,” as proposed by Chambers and Tzavella [8].' [`dirnagl2020preregistration`]


'Theory, meta-research, and a plethora of highly publicized examples indicate that spectacular results, which promise major advances, unfortunately must often be nonreproducible or even false [11].' [`dirnagl2020preregistration`]

'Could RRs be useful in qualitative research? Yes. To the extent that publication
bias is a concern in both qualitative and quantitative research [89].' [`chambers2022past`]

One preregisters to show the study was explorative, 
hence preventing to say it was a confirmation study too.


Table 1. Misconceptions and realities of Registered Reports (RRs) from [`chambers2022past`]:

- 1. RRs hamper exploratory research|RRs can include clearly labelled post hoc analyses at Stage 2, and almost all published RRs do.
- 2. RRs limit creativity or serendipity|The opposite is more likely. Assessing study design and rationale in the absence of results encourages a perceptive evaluation of why a study is worth conducting in the first place, and IPA† protects serendipitous discoveries from publication bias.
- 3. RRs are only for “single shot” studies|RRs in many journals can include preliminary studies (e.g. Heycke et al.124), prespecified sequences of studies (e.g. Ait Ouares et al.125) or incremental registrations after Stage 2 acceptance.
- 4. RRs are particularly vulnerable to scooping|In 7 years there have been no reports of scooping linked to RRs, and Stage 1 protocols can be kept under private embargo until Stage 2 submission or acceptance. In the rare event of an idea being appropriated and implemented by a reviewer faster than the authors, doing so would have no effect on publication of the RR because “novelty” is not assessed at Stage 2.
- 5. RRs can be easily gamed by “post-registering” a study that the authors have already conducted
- 6. RRs require authors to prespecify a fixed plan that cannot be changed
- 7. RRs are not suitable for studying hard-to-reach samples and/or for researchers with limited resources
- 8. RRs are not suitable for early career researchers (ECRs)
- 9. RRs will slow the pace of research
- 10. RRs give reviewers too much power to decide what research is undertaken

[`bakker2020ensuring`] describes the process of data exploration, also for exploratory.
