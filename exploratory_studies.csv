The aim of the current research is to explore trait anxiety and differences in saccadic and keypress responding as potential determinants of performance on flexibility tasks in AN. Method We will compare performance on the mixed pro- anti-saccade paradigm between female adult participants with a current diagnosis of AN and matched control participants, observing both saccadic and keypress responses while controlling for trait anxiety (State - Trait Anxiety Inventory) and spatial working memory (Corsi Block Tapping Test). Associations with eating disorder-related symptoms (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire), flexibility in everyday life (Eating Disorder Flexibility Index), and the Clinical Perfectionism Questionnaire will also be assessed. Results Data which controls for individual differences in trait anxiety and assesses flexibility at both the task- and response-set level may be used to more accurately understand differences in performance on cognitive flexibility tasks by participants with AN. Discussion Clarifying the effects of trait anxiety on flexibility, and differences between task- and response-set switching may advance our understanding of how cognitive flexibility relates to flexibility in everyday life and improve translation to therapeutic approaches. Public significance statement This research will compare performance on a flexibility task between participants with anorexia nervosa (AN) and controls while observing their eye-movements to examine whether trait anxiety and type of response (eye-movement and keypress) are associated with performance. This data may improve our understanding of why participants with AN perform more poorly on cognitive flexibility tasks, and how poor cognitive flexibility relates to eating disorder-related issues with flexibility in everyday life.","2022","2023-06-13 16:12:55","2023-06-13T16:12:55Z","2023-02-24 21:39:28","1411-1417","","10","55","","","Assessing cognitive flexibility in anorexia nervosa using eye tracking","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23779","","","","life science","anorexia nervosa; anti-saccade; clinical perfectionism; cognitive flexibility; eating disorders; eye movements; eye-tracking; task switching; trait anxiety; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using Chinese (N = 1533) and British (N = 1371) samples recruited from the online platforms WJX and Prolific, we assessed contact comfort with targets who were either East Asian or White and who were either modified to have symptoms of infection or unmodified (or, for exploratory purposes, modified to wear facemasks). Contact comfort was lower for targets modified to have symptoms of infection. However, we detected no differences in contact comfort with ethnic-ingroup targets versus ethnic-outgroup targets.

Evidence suggests cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be useful in the post-acute period, but few patients have access to trained providers. mHealth technologies have potential to increase access to high-quality care for AN, including in the post-acute period. The aim of this study is to estimate the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU), offered with and without an accompanying social networking feature. Method In the current pilot randomized controlled trial, women with AN who have been discharged from acute treatment in the past 2 months (N = 90) will be randomly assigned to a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU), a CBT-based mobile intervention including social networking plus TAU, or TAU alone. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the three conditions in terms of reducing eating disorder psychopathology, reducing frequency of eating disorder behaviors, achieving weight maintenance, reducing depression and suicidal ideation, and reducing clinical impairment. We will examine rehospitalization and full recovery rates in an exploratory fashion. We will also examine whether the mobile intervention and social networking feature change the proposed targets and whether changes in targets are associated with benefit, as well as conduct exploratory analyses to identify within-mobile intervention predictors and moderators of outcome. Discussion Ultimately, this research may lead to increased access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with AN and prevention of the extreme negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder. Public Significance Relapse after acute treatment for anorexia nervosa is common, and few patients have access to trained providers to support them following acute care. This study will pilot a coached mobile app, including a social networking component, for this population. If ultimately successful, our approach could greatly increase access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with anorexia nervosa and ultimately prevent the extreme negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder.","1970-01-01","2023-06-13 15:24:45","2023-06-13T15:24:45Z","2023-02-24 14:45:20","","","n/a","n/a","","","A pilot randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral therapy-guided self-help mobile app for the post-acute treatment of anorexia nervosa","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23891","","","","life science","anorexia nervosa; eating disorders; mobile intervention; post-acute treatment; social networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we use a pupillary index to adjudicate between two existing hypotheses about how irrational biases emerge: the hypothesis that biases result from fast, effortless processing and the hypothesis that biases result from more extensive integration. While effortless processing is associated with smaller pupillary responses, more extensive integration is associated with larger pupillary responses. Thus, we tested the relationship between pupil response and choice behaviour on six different foundational decision-making tasks that are classically used to demonstrate irrational biases. Participants demonstrated the expected systematic biases and their pupillary measurements satisfied pre-specified quality checks. Planned analyses returned inconclusive results, but exploratory examination of the data revealed an association between high pupillary responses and biased decisions. The findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that biases arise from gradual information integration.","2021-05","2023-02-24 21:29:10","2023-02-24T21:29:10Z","2023-02-24 21:29:10","653-662","","5","5","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 5 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Decision; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the presence of these gradients remains undetermined in many brain regions. Resting-state neuroimaging studies have suggested these gradients can be reconstructed from patterns of functional connectivity. Here we investigate the accuracy of these reconstructions and establish whether it is connectivity or the functional properties within a region that determine these “connectopic maps”. Different manifold learning techniques were used to recover visual field maps while participants were at rest or engaged in natural viewing. We benchmarked these reconstructions against maps measured by traditional visual field mapping. We report an initial exploratory experiment of a publicly available naturalistic imaging dataset, followed by a preregistered replication using larger resting-state and naturalistic imaging datasets from the Human Connectome Project. Connectopic mapping accurately predicted visual field maps in primary visual cortex, with better predictions for eccentricity than polar angle maps. Non-linear manifold learning methods outperformed simpler linear embeddings. We also found more accurate predictions during natural viewing compared to resting-state. Varying the source of the connectivity estimates had minimal impact on the connectopic maps, suggesting the key factor is the functional topography within a brain region. The application of these standardised methods for connectopic mapping will allow the discovery of functional gradients across the brain.","2022-09-28","2023-02-24 19:14:06","2023-02-24T19:14:06Z","2023-02-24 19:14:06","16249","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2022 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Computational neuroscience; Striate cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cortical thickness (CT) is a neural correlate of performance and learning. In this registered report, we used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to investigate the relationship between CT in the core brain network of FC and performance on a psychometric task battery, including tasks with facial content. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we tested the existence of face-specific interindividual differences at behavioural and neural levels. The measurement models include general and face-specific factors of performance and CT. There was no face-specificity in CT in functionally localized areas. In post hoc analyses, we compared the preregistered, small regions of interest (ROIs) to larger, non-individualized ROIs and identified a face-specific CT factor when large ROIs were considered. We show that this was probably due to low reliability of CT in the functional localization (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) between 0.72 and 0.85). Furthermore, general cognitive ability, but not face-specific performance, could be predicted by latent factors of CT with a small effect size. In conclusion, for the core brain network of FC, we provide exploratory evidence (in need of cross-validation) that areas of the cortex sharing a functional purpose did also share morphological properties as measured by CT.","","2019-10-31 20:40:49","2019-10-31T20:40:49Z","2019-10-14 17:39:52","180857","","7","6","","Royal Society Open Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00001  https://osf.io/p7c8z/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given a set of initial seeds, greybox fuzzing continuously generates new test inputs to execute the program under test and gravitates executions towards rarely explored program regions with code coverage as feedback. Seed prioritization is an important step of greybox fuzzing that prioritizes promising seeds for input generation. However, mainstream greybox fuzzers like AFL++ and Zest tend to slight the importance of seed prioritization and plainly pick seeds according to the order of the seeds being queued, or rely on an approach with randomness, which may consequently degrade their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based seed prioritization approach named DiPri to facilitate greybox fuzzing. Specifically, DiPri calculates the distances among seeds and selects the ones that are farther from the others in priority to improve the probabilities of discovering previously unexplored regions. To make a preliminary evaluation, we integrate DiPri into AFL++ and Zest and conduct experiments on eight (four in C/C++ and four in Java) fuzz targets. We also consider six configurations, i.e., three prioritization modes multiplied by two distance measures, in our evaluation to investigate how different prioritization timings and measures affect DiPri. The experimental results show that, compared to the default seed prioritization approaches of AFL++ and Zest, DiPri covers 1.87%∼13.86% more edges in three out of four C/C++ fuzz targets and 0.29%∼4.97% more edges in the four Java fuzz targets with certain configurations. The results highlight the potential of facilitating greybox fuzzing with distance-based seed prioritization.","2023-07-17","2023-08-18 21:45:47","2023-08-18T21:45:47Z","2023-08-18 00:00:00","21–30","","","","","","DiPri","FUZZING 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Citation Key: qianDiPriDistanceBasedSeed2023","","","","","Greybox Fuzzing; Seed Distance; Seed Prioritization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of course, the fuzzers themselves are still written in memory-unsafe languages.

Based on the rust fuzzer library libafl, we develop ourtool, a drop-in replacement for the C++ component of cargo-fuzz. We evaluate our tool, written in rust, against the original fuzzer libfuzzer. We show that we are not only able to successfully fuzz all three targets we tested with ourtool, but outperform cargo-fuzz in bug coverage. During our preliminary evaluation, we already manage to uncover new bugs in the pdf crate that could not be found by cargo-fuzz, proving the real-world applicability of our approach, and giving us high hopes for the planned follow-up evaluations.","2023-07-17","2023-08-18 21:45:44","2023-08-18T21:45:44Z","2023-08-18 00:00:00","39–46","","","","","","CrabSandwich","FUZZING 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Citation Key: crumpCrabSandwichFuzzingRust2023","","","","","framework; fuzzing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has identified cross-modal associations between musical features such as pitch, tempo, and visual features including height, and colour saturation/brightness. But while researchers have explored cross-cultural links between music and emotion as well as music and visual imagery, few studies have simultaneously investigated cross-cultural links between music, visual imagery, and emotion in order to distinguish the role of cultural experiences in contrast to innate perceptual capabilities. We hypothesize that cross-cultural emotion and cross-modal associations encompass both universality and diversity determined by innate perceptual capabilities and cultural experiences respectively and represented by: 1) cross-culturally consistent correlations between high level auditory features and low level visual features and dimensional emotions, 2) cross-cultural diversity in categorical emotional appraisal. In this study, we investigate the relationship between emotion and visual imagery induced by 6 musical excerpts in participants in Japan, Iran, and Canada through forced choice options such as matching excerpts with visual textures that vary in density, as well as dimensional and categorical emotion ratings for each excerpt manipulated in pitch and tempo. In our full manuscript, we will provide our power analysis and provide the details of our planned sample size.We will test the following four hypotheses: 1) tempo correlates with arousal levels cross-culturally, 2) tempo correlates with visual density cross-culturally, 3) emotion category ratings tend to vary between cultures and often even within cultures in response to slow tempo musical excerpts, and 4) emotion ratings show more consistency cross-culturally in response to faster tempo pieces.Each of the hypotheses helps us conclude which cross-modal and emotion associations are 1) cross-culturally consistent, or 2) culturally-dependent. If we find cross-cultural consistency across all three groups, it would suggest physiological link/embodied cognition represented in cross-modal associations. If we find consistency in two cultures only or none at all, it would suggest that cross-modal associations are culturally dependent.

Over the past two decades, interest in the influence of tDCS on behaviour has increased markedly, resulting in a large body of literature spanning multiple domains. However, the effect of tDCS on human performance often varies, bringing into question the reliability of this approach. While reviews and meta-analyses highlight the contributions of methodological inconsistencies and individual differences, no published studies have directly tested the intra-individual reliability of tDCS effects on behaviour. Here, we conducted a large scale, double-blinded, sham-controlled registered report to assess the reliability of two single-session low-dose tDCS montages, previously found to impact response selection and motor learning operations, across two separate time periods. Our planned analysis found no evidence for either protocol being effective nor reliable. Post-hoc explorative analyses found evidence that tDCS influenced motor learning, but not response selection learning. In addition, the reliability of motor learning performance across trials was shown to be disrupted by tDCS. These findings are amongst the first to shed light specifically on the intra-individual reliability of tDCS effects on behaviour and provide valuable information to the field.","2024-04-01","2024-04-06 02:29:36","2024-04-06T02:29:36Z","2024-04-05 16:13:17","61-79","","","173","","Cortex","Exploring the intra-individual reliability of tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: Willmot-2024","","","","","Behaviour; Intra-individual; Motor-learning; Reliability; Response-learning; tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of automated driving systems (ADSs) in the real world requires rigorous testing to ensure safety. To increase trust, ADSs should be tested on a large set of diverse road scenarios. Literature suggests that if a vehicle is driven along a set of geometrically diverse roads-measured using various diversity measures (DMs)-it will react in a wide range of behaviours, thereby increasing the chances of observing failures (if any), or strengthening the confidence in its safety, if no failures are observed. To the best of our knowledge, however, this assumption has never been tested before, nor have road DMs been assessed for their properties. Objective/Aim. Our goal is to perform an exploratory study on 47 currently used and new, potentially promising road DMs. Specifically, our research questions look into the road DMs themselves, to analyse their properties (e.g. monotonicity, computation efficiency), and to test correlation between DMs. Furthermore, we look at the use of road DMs to investigate whether the assumption that diverse test suites of roads expose diverse driving behaviour holds. Method. Our empirical analysis relies on a state-of-the-art, open-source ADSs testing infrastructure and uses a data set containing over 97,000 individual road geometries and matching simulation data that were collected using two driving agents. By sampling random test suites of various sizes and measuring their roads' geometric diversity, we study road DMs properties, the correlation between road DMs, and the correlation between road DMs and the observed behaviour.","2022-09-13","2023-02-24 19:13:19","2023-02-24T19:13:19Z","2023-02-24 19:13:19","","","","","","","Does Road Diversity Really Matter in Testing Automated Driving Systems?","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2209.05947 [cs]","","","","","Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2209.05947","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This registered report assessed design characteristics of registered clinical trials for COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 trials to empirically explore the design of clinical research during a pandemic and how it compares to research conducted in non-pandemic times. We did a retrospective cohort study with a 1 : 1 ratio of interventional COVID-19 registrations to non-COVID-19 registrations, with four trial design outcomes: use of control arm, randomization, blinding and prospective registration. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of investigating COVID-19 versus not COVID-19 and estimate direct and total effects of investigating COVID-19 for each outcome. The primary analysis showed a positive direct and total effect of COVID-19 on the use of control arms and randomization. It showed a negative direct effect of COVID-19 on blinding but no evidence of a total effect. There was no evidence of an effect on prospective registration. Taken together with secondary and sensitivity analyses, our findings are inconclusive but point towards a higher prevalence of key design characteristics in COVID-19 trials versus controls. The findings do not support much existing COVID-19 research quality literature, which generally suggests that COVID-19 led to a reduction in quality.

Two psychological approaches to the study of SES say they are, but emphasize different reasons. The rank approach argues that because individuals with lower SES experience low rank, they feel less in control and more threatened by others, so it is more valuable for them to understand others' mental states. The cultural approach argues that because lower SES cultures foster more interdependent values, people steeped in those cultures focus more on others, leading them to better understand others' mental states. Previous tests of the basic hypothesis these two approaches share have yielded mixed evidence. This registered report uses a large-scale, nationally representative sample to accomplish two goals. First, it tests the basic shared hypothesis, finding that lower subjective rank, social class cultural group, and income—but not education—all predict better empathic accuracy. Second, it explores additional research questions, finding that subjective rank more strongly predicts empathic accuracy compared to SES cultural group (consistent with the rank approach), but childhood SES more strongly predicts empathic accuracy than adulthood SES (consistent with the cultural approach). Results regarding the moderating role of the valence of the mental state being recognized were not consistent. We conclude there is indeed a negative association between social class and empathic accuracy, and discuss the degree to which this is due to the psychology of rank and childhood cultural socialization.","2024-03-01","2024-01-13 07:59:52","2024-01-13T07:59:52Z","2024-01-12 16:01:28","104577","","","111","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Lower social class, better social skills?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: Engstrom-2024","","","","","Empathic accuracy; Registered report; Social class; Socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We verified whether recognizing discrepancies between personal memories and externally suggested information, along with certain individual differences, moderates the memory distrust-suggestibility link. Methods Experiment 1 (N = 306) followed a classic three-step procedure with a discrepancy awareness test. In Experiment 2 (N = 316) a computerized version of the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale with a discrepancy awareness test was utilized. Both experiments manipulated the state of memory distrust and assessed participants' trait memory distrust, compliance, anxiety and self-esteem. Results While the effect of memory deterioration due to misinformation and suggestions was replicated, the hypotheses regarding the relationship between memory distrust and suggestibility were not confirmed. However, for interrogative suggestibility, individuals induced to doubt their own memory were more susceptible to suggestions when recognizing inconsistencies between the story and suggestive questions. Conclusions From the theoretical side, the concept of memory distrust appears to be useful to explain the reasons for succumbing to suggestions. However, our findings indicate that memory distrust toward committing omission errors and the experimentally induced state appear unrelated (misinformation effect paradigm) or marginally related (memory distrust state and interrogative suggestibility) to the tendency to yield to suggestions. This prompts further research using a different operationalisation of this construct.","","2023-11-10 15:32:03","2023-11-10T15:32:03Z","2023-11-10 15:31:21","","","n/a","n/a","","","Memory distrust and suggestibility","","","","","","","en","© 2023 British Psychological Society.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/lcrp.12249 Citation Key: Dudek-","","","","","discrepancy detection; interrogative suggestibility; memory distrust; misinformation effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its flexibility, automated nature, and effectiveness render it an indispensable tool for making software more secure. A key feature that enables its impressive performance is coverage feedback, which guides the fuzzer to explore different parts of the program. The most prominent way to use this feedback is novelty search, in which the fuzzer generates new inputs and only keeps those that have exercised a new program edge. This is grounded in the assumption that novel coverage is a proxy for interestingness. Bolstered by its widespread success, it is easy to overlook its limitations. Particularly the phenomenon of input shadowing, situations in which an “interesting” input is discarded because it does not contribute novel coverage, needs to be considered. This phenomenon limits the explorable input space and risks missing bugs when shadowed inputs are more amenable to mutations that would trigger bugs. In this work, we analyze input shadowing in more detail and find that multiple fuzzing runs of the same target exhibit a different basic block hit frequency despite overlapping code coverage. In other words, different fuzzing runs may find the same set of basic blocks but one might exercise specific basic blocks significantly more often than the other, and vice versa. To better distribute the frequency, we propose restarting the fuzzer to reset the fuzzing state, diversifying the fuzzer’s attention across basic blocks. Our preliminary evaluation of three Fuzzbench targets finds that fuzzer restarts effectively distribute the basic block hit frequencies and boost the achieved coverage by up to 9.3%.","2023-07-17","2023-08-18 21:45:49","2023-08-18T21:45:49Z","2023-08-18 00:00:00","12–20","","","","","","Novelty Not Found","FUZZING 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Citation Key: schillerNoveltyNotFound2023","","","","","Fuzzing; Software Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comorbid exercise dependence (ExD) is common in AN and associated with significantly worse symptom severity and treatment outcomes. Research points to cognitive inflexibility as a prominent executive function inefficiency and transdiagnostic etiologic and maintaining mechanism linking AN and ExD. This study will evaluate the initial efficacy of adjunctive Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT), which has been shown to produce cognitive improvements in adults with AN, in targeting cognitive inflexibility in individuals with comorbid AN and ExD. As an exploratory aim, this study also addresses the current lack of quick and cost-effective assessments of cognitive flexibility by establishing the utility of two proposed biomarkers, heart rate variability and salivary oxytocin. Method We will conduct a single-group, within-subjects trial of an established CRT protocol delivered remotely as an adjunct to inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment as usual (TAU) to adult patients (n = 42) with comorbid AN and ExD. Assessments, including self-report, neuropsychological, and biomarker measurements, will occur at three time points. Results We expect CRT to increase cognitive flexibility transdiagnostically and consequently, along with TAU, positively impact AN and ExD compulsivity and symptom severity, including weight gain. Discussion Findings will inform the development of more effective integrative interventions for AN and ExD targeting shared mechanisms and facilitate the routine assessment of cognitive flexibility as a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor across psychopathologies in clinical and research settings. Public Significance Patients with anorexia nervosa often engage in excessive exercise, leading to harmful outcomes, including increased suicidal behavior. This study examines the preliminary efficacy of an intervention that fosters flexible and holistic thinking in patients with problematic eating and exercise to, along with routine treatment, decrease harmful exercise symptoms. This study also examines new biological markers of the inflexible thinking style thought to be characteristic of anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence.","1970-01-01","2023-06-13 13:42:36","2023-06-13T13:42:36Z","2023-04-14 17:04:07","","","n/a","n/a","","","Impact of virtual adjunctive cognitive remediation therapy on cognitive flexibility and treatment outcomes in comorbid anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence as quantified using novel biomarkers","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.23942","","","","life science","anorexia nervosa; cognitive flexibility; cognitive remediation therapy; exercise dependence; heart rate variability; oxytocin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to this framework, choices are preceded by affective, integrative, and motivational processes, which may all be affected by aging. The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task allows tapping into several mechanisms proposed by the AIM framework, and the present registered report aimed to explore the temporal resolution of the EEG to find the neural correlates of age differences in such mechanisms, including gain/loss anticipation, value integration, motivational processes underlying motor choice, as well as processing of positive/negative rewards. The electrophysiological data were recorded from 77 participants (20–80 years old), and we analyzed the Cue-P3, Contingent Negative Variation, target-P3, Feedback-related Negativity, and the Feedback-P3. The results support the AIM framework, suggesting that aging altered affective processes (as shown by a significant reduced cue-P3 in the older group), while preserved integration and motivation processes. However, despite a general lack of significant group by domain interactions across the ERPs analyzed, the results of the planned comparisons are suggestive of a preserved processing of gains and affected processing of losses during aging. This conclusion requires further replication with larger samples, but our study shows that future research may profit from decomposing decision processes to understand how biological aging affects decision making.","2022-08-01","2023-02-24 21:35:42","2023-02-24T21:35:42Z","2023-02-24 21:35:42","119189","","","256","","NeuroImage","Neurophysiological examination of the Affect–Integratio–Motivation framework of decision-making in the aging brain","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Aging; Economic decision-making; Event-related potentials; Feedback processing; Rewards anticipation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Other theories suggest that sleep's role in memory is not restricted to consolidation. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that new learning is implemented in the brain through strengthening synaptic connections, a biologically costly process that gradually saturates encoding capacity during wake. During slow-wave sleep, synaptic strength is renormalized, thus restoring memory encoding ability. While the role of sleep in memory consolidation has been extensively documented, few human studies have explored the impact of sleep in restoring encoding ability, and none have looked at learning beyond episodic memory. In this registered report we test the predictions made by the complementary learning systems accounts and the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis regarding adult participants' ability to learn new words, and to integrate these words with existing knowledge. Participants took a polysomnographically-monitored daytime nap or remained awake prior to learning a set of new spoken words. Shortly after learning, and again on the following day, we measured participants' episodic memory for new words. We also assessed the degree to which newly learned words engage in competition with existing words. We predicted that sleep before encoding would result in better episodic memory for the words, and facilitate the overnight integration of new words with existing words. Based on existing literature and theory we further predicted that this restorative function is associated with slow-wave and sleep spindle activity. Our pre-registered analyses did not find a significant benefit of napping prior to encoding on word learning or integration. Exploratory analyses using a more sensitive measure of recall accuracy demonstrated significantly better performance in the nap condition compared to the no-nap condition in the immediate test. At the delayed test there was no longer a significant benefit of the nap. Of note, we found no significant effect of slow-wave activity prior to encoding on episodic memory or integration of newly learned words into the mental lexicon. However, we found that greater levels of Stage 2 sleep spindles were significantly associated with greater improvements in lexical competition from the immediate to the delayed test. Therefore, our results demonstrate some support for theories that implicate sleep spindles in restoring encoding capacity.","2023-02-01","2023-02-24 16:41:28","2023-02-24T16:41:28Z","2023-02-24 16:41:28","142-166","","","159","","Cortex","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Complementary learning systems; Daytime napping; Language learning; Sleep; Synaptic homeostasis hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Process–related research has started to provide more insight into how agreeableness–related traits give rise to various antisocial and prosocial behaviours.

Existing research has used cross-sectional designs with easy-to-obtain but unreliable self-report measures of playtime, or, in rare instances, obtained industry data on objectively-tracked playtime but only for individual games, not a player’s total playtime across games. Further, researchers have raised concerns that publication bias and a lack of differentiation between exploratory and confirmatory research have undermined the credibility of the evidence base. As a result, we still do not know whether wellbeing affects playtime, playtime affects wellbeing, both, or neither. To track people’s playtime across multiple games, we developed a method to log playtime on the Xbox platform. In a 12-week, 6-wave panel study of adult US/UK Xbox-predominant players (414 players, 2036 completed surveys), we investigated within-person temporal relations between objectively-measured playtime and wellbeing. Across multiple preregistered model specifications, we found that the within-person prospective relationships between playtime and wellbeing, or vice versa, were not practically significant—even the largest associations were unlikely to register a perceptible impact on a player’s wellbeing.  These results support the growing body of evidence that playtime is not the primary factor in the relationship between gaming and mental health for the majority of players, and that research focus should be on the context and quality of gameplay instead.","2024-01-12","2024-01-13 07:59:55","2024-01-13T07:59:55Z","2024-01-12 15:18:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-us","","","","","osf.io","","Publisher: OSF Citation Key: Ballou-2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A critical area in this regard is the lack of clarity concerning the differences between gaming disorder and intensive play, the latter of which often involves several gaming hours per day without related health problems. In this study, we approached the above question by interpretive phenomenological analysis with interviews in two groups of highly involved videogame players: those who seek or have sought clinical help for their problems with gaming (n=6), and those who play esports more than 4 hours per day without self-reported related health problems (n=10). The interviews were carried out by using a new Phenomenology of Play (POP) interview frame. These data were contextualized with interviews of medical experts (n=6) who have experience of working with the former group. The findings imply that experiences of disorder derive from gaming interfering with what one wants to be, do, and have throughout life, whereas the experiences of intensive esport play derive from gaming being integrated into self throughout life.

Our goal was to investigate how screening instruments that derive from different ontologies differ in identifying associated problem groups. By using four central screening instruments, each representing a different ontological basis, we hypothesized differences and similarities in prevalence, overlap, and health. A nationally representative (N = 8217) sample of Finnish participants was collected. The screening instruments produced significantly different prevalence rates (from 0.4% to 6.9%) and the binomial probabilities of group overlap ranged from poor (0.419) to good (0.919). Expectedly, the problem groups had lower mental health than the general population, yet exploratory analyses implied equivalent or significantly higher physical health. We also found strong exploratory evidence for mischievous responding to complicate the measurement of gaming problems. Considering that several major differences were confirmed between the four gaming problem constructs, we recommend researchers to clearly define their construct of interest, i.e. whether they are studying the ICD-11 based official mental disorder, the DSM-5 proposed ‘internet gaming disorder’, or other gaming problems—especially in future meta-analyses.","2022-09-05","2023-02-24 19:12:30","2023-02-24T19:12:30Z","2023-02-24 19:12:30","1-11","","0","0","","","Ontological diversity in gaming disorder measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/16066359.2022.2115033","","","","","Behavioral addiction; games; open science; philosophy; prevalence; technology use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the study explores how the use of default masculine grammatical gender can create a male-bias in perception. The secondary aim of this research is to test whether gender-inclusive language can reduce this male-bias in perception and instead increase the accessibility, activation, and retrieval of exemplars related to other gender minorities (i.e., reduce male-bias in perception).

Large-scale replication attempts for psychological results yielded shockingly low success rates and contributed to an increasing demand for open science practices among psychologists. However, preregistering one’s studies is still not the norm in the field. Here, we conducted a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy. Methods In a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an online survey assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Respondents (N = 289) were psychological researchers that were recruited through their publications on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predicted that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers’ intention to preregister (directional hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expected an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (non-directional hypothesis 2). We analyzed these hypotheses with multiple regression models and included preregistration experience as a control variable. Results Researchers’ attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and the perceived importance of preregistration significantly predicted researchers’ intention to use preregistration in the future (see hypothesis 1). Research experience influenced both researchers’ attitudes and their perception of motivations to preregister, but not the perception of obstacles (see hypothesis 2). Descriptive reports on researchers’ attitudes, motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration are provided. Discussion Many researchers had already preregistered and had a rather positive attitude toward preregistration. Nevertheless, several obstacles were identified that may be addressed to improve and foster preregistration.","2023-03-16","2023-04-11 17:19:46","2023-04-11T17:19:46Z","2023-04-11 17:19:44","e0281086","","3","18","","PLOS ONE","Registered report","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Behavior; Careers; Motivation; Open science; Pilot studies; Psychological attitudes; Psychology; Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even the current version of the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards does mention payouts for completing surveys only, but not for mimicking the real-world or motivating realistic behavior during experiments. So, there is a lack of understanding regarding whether financial incentives can or cannot be useful for software-engineering experimentation. To tackle this problem, we plan a survey based on which we will conduct a controlled laboratory experiment. Precisely, we will use the survey to elicit incentivization schemes we will employ as (up to) four payoff functions (i.e., mappings of choices or performance in an experiment to a monetary payment) during a code-review task in the experiment: (1) a scheme that employees prefer, (2) a scheme that is actually employed, (3) a scheme that is performance-independent, and (4) a scheme that mimics an open-source scenario. Using a between-subject design, we aim to explore how the different schemes impact the participants' performance.

The present research explored how features of measured attributes and individual differences affect the relationship between implicit and explicit measures using existing data (Hussey, Hughes, & Nosek, 2018). In the original study, participants completed measures of explicit evaluation or identification (i.e., difference scores between self-report items) and implicit evaluation or identification (i.e., the Implicit Association Test; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) for one of 95 target pairs. First, we attempted to conceptually replicate Nosek's (2005) findings that self-presentation, distinctiveness, elaboration/importance, and complementarity moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations across individuals irrespective of attribute targets. These attribute features each moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations and accounted for unique variation in implicit-explicit relations. Second, we tested whether these features affected the relationship between implicit and explicit identifications. We found moderating effects of distinctiveness and complementarity but not of the other attribute features, likely due to their operationalization. Finally, we examined whether theoretically relevant individual difference measures moderated the relationship between implicit and explicit evaluations or identifications. Across almost all analyses, these measures (i.e., socially desirable responding, self-monitoring, need for cognition, personal need for structure, and need for cognitive closure) did not moderate implicit-explicit relations. Taken together, our results suggest that relationships between implicit and explicit measures reflect individual experiences with attribute targets rather than the cultural context, targets, or individuals themselves.","2022-05-01","2023-02-24 21:39:37","2023-02-24T21:39:37Z","2023-02-24 21:39:37","104280","","","100","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Registered report","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Implicit bias; Implicit measures; Implicit-explicit relations; Individual differences; Moderation; Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.","2022-11-18","2023-02-24 21:40:02","2023-02-24T21:40:02Z","2023-02-24 21:40:02","","","","","","","Stage 1 Registered Report","","","","","F1000Research","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","f1000research.com","","DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.125649.2 Type: article","","","","","affective neuroscience; laboratory animal welfare; playful handling; positive animal welfare; protocol; rat tickling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11:1053","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present article explores the validity of such an implicit measure by proposing several extensions and adaptions. We addressed methodological problems of a me/not-me response latency task developed in this literature by proposing changes in material, calculation of indices and implemented the task in an online environment. We also addressed earlier problems with statistical power and proposed a more powerful way of statistical analyses using mixed models. The me/not-me task is based on the idea that higher overlap between self and other traits results in faster response times of characterizing such a trait as descriptive of the self. This relationship should be observed for close others but not for non-close others. In a sample of 339 U.S American adults, we experimentally manipulated the nature of the target (close vs. distant) and participants engaged in the adapted me/not-me paradigm. Results indicated that trait match had a stronger negative effect on response times for participants in the close condition. The effect was also stronger for participants rating the target higher on the IOS self-report scale. We also provided convergent validity of the me/not-me procedure with other constructs ostensibly measuring interpersonal closeness. Future applications and possible limitations are discussed.","2017-04-28","2021-01-06 14:42:01","2021-01-06T14:42:01Z","2017-05-04 11:42:58","1-24","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","","","","Inclusion of the other in the self; implicit measure; interpersonal closeness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The feature-based view assumes that object knowledge is grounded in a widely distributed neural network in terms of sensory/function features (e.g., Warrington &amp; Shallice, 1984), while the category-based view assumes in addition that object knowledge is organized by taxonomic and thematic categories (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2011). Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation paradigm, we compared predictions from the feature- and category-based views by examining the neural substrates recruited as subjects read word pairs that were identical, taxonomically related, thematically related or unrelated while controlling for the function features involved across the two categories. We improved upon previous study designs and employed an fMRI adaptation task, obtaining results overall consistent with both the category-based and feature-based views. Consistent with the category-based view, we observed for both hypothesized regions of interest (ROI) and exploratory (whole-brain analyses) reduced activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) for taxonomically related versus unrelated word pairs, and for the exploratory analysis only, reduced activity in the right ATL. In addition, the exploratory analyses revealed reduced activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) for thematically related versus unrelated word pairs. Consistent with the feature-based view, we found in the exploratory analyses that activity reduced in the bilateral precentral gyri (i.e., function regions) including part of premotor cortex as the function relatedness ratings increased. However, we did not find a relationship between adaptation effects in the bilateral ATLs and left TPJ and corresponding ratings of taxonomic/thematic relationships suggesting that the adaptation effects may potentially not reflect aspects of taxonomy that have been traditionally assumed. Together, our findings indicate that both feature and category information are important for the organization of object knowledge although the exact nature of those organization principles is an important question for future research.","2016-02-06","2019-10-31 20:34:57","2019-10-31T20:34:57Z","2017-05-04 21:19:49","174-194","","","78","","Cortex","Role of features and categories in the organization of object knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Features; Taxonomic category; The organization of object knowledge; Thematic category","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroimaging studies report brain structural associations with both pubertal timing and depression. However, whether brain structure mediates the relationship between pubertal timing and depression remains unclear. Methods The current registered report examined associations between pubertal timing (indexed via perceived pubertal development), brain structure (cortical and subcortical metrics, and white matter microstructure) and depressive symptoms in a large sample (N = ~5,000) of adolescents (aged 9-13 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used three waves of follow-up data when the youth were aged 10-11 years, 11-12 years, and 12-13 years, respectively. We used generalised linear-mixed models (H1) and structural equation modelling (H2 & H3) to test our hypotheses. Hypotheses We hypothesised that earlier pubertal timing at Year 1 would be associated with increased depressive symptoms at Year 3 (H1), and that this relationship would be mediated by global (H2a-b) and regional (H3a-g) brain structural measures at Year 2. Global measures included reduced cortical volume, thickness, surface area and sulcal depth. Regional measures included reduced cortical thickness and volume in temporal and fronto-parietal areas, increased cortical volume in the ventral diencephalon, increased sulcal depth in the pars orbitalis, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the cortico-striatal tract and corpus callosum. These regions of interest were informed by our pilot analyses using baseline ABCD data when the youth were aged 9-10 years. Results Earlier pubertal timing was associated with increased depressive symptoms two years later. The magnitude of effect was stronger in female youth and the association remained significant when controlling for parental depression, family income, and BMI in females but not in male youth. Our hypothesised brain structural measures did not however mediate the association between earlier pubertal timing and later depressive symptoms. Conclusion The present results demonstrate that youth, particularly females, who begin puberty ahead of their peers are at an increased risk for adolescent-onset depression. Future work should explore additional biological and socio-environmental factors that may affect this association so that we can identify targets for intervention to help these at-risk youth.","2023-02-24","2023-02-27 20:40:42","2023-02-27T20:40:42Z","2023-02-27 20:40:40","101223","","","","","Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience","The role of brain structure in the association between pubertal timing and depression risk in an early adolescent sample (the ABCD Study®)","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","ABCD Study; adolescent depression; brain structure; pubertal timing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With most youth using the internet, electronic health (eHealth) interventions are promising tools for reaching this population. Through participatory design research (PDR) engagement methods, Thought Spot, a Web- and mobile-based platform, was redeveloped to facilitate access to mental health services by transition-aged youth (aged 16-29 years) in postsecondary settings. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the process of engaging with postsecondary students through the PDR approaches, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the Thought Spot platform. Methods: Consistent with the PDR approaches, five student-led workshops, attended by 41 individuals, were facilitated to obtain feedback regarding the platform’s usability and functionality and its potential value in a postsecondary setting. Various creative engagement activities were delivered to gather experiences and opinions, including semistructured focus groups, questionnaires, personas, journey mapping, and a world café. Innovative technological features and refinements were also brainstormed during the workshops. Results: By using PDR methods of engagement, participants knew that their ideas and recommendations would be applied. There was also an overall sense of respect and care integrated into each group, which facilitated an exchange of ideas and suggestions. Conclusions: The process of engaging with students to redesign the Thought Spot platform through PDR has been effective. Findings from these workshops will significantly inform new technological features within the app to enable positive help-seeking behaviors among students. These behaviors will be further explored in the second phase that involves a randomized controlled trial.

The rapid rise in their use has created the need for a systematic synthesis of the evidence of their impact as knowledge translation (KT) tools in the health care sector and for an inventory of the factors that affect their use. Objective: Through the Levac six-stage methodology, a scoping review was undertaken to explore the depth and breadth of evidence about the effective, safe, and ethical use of wikis and collaborative writing applications (CWAs) in health care. Methods: Multiple strategies were used to locate studies. Seven scientific databases and 6 grey literature sources were queried for articles on wikis and CWAs published between 2001 and September 16, 2011. In total, 4436 citations and 1921 grey literature items were screened. Two reviewers independently reviewed citations, selected eligible studies, and extracted data using a standardized form. We included any paper presenting qualitative or quantitative empirical evidence concerning health care and CWAs. We defined a CWA as any technology that enables the joint and simultaneous editing of a webpage or an online document by many end users. We performed qualitative content analysis to identify the factors that affect the use of CWAs using the Gagnon framework and their effects on health care using the Donabedian framework. Results: Of the 111 studies included, 4 were experimental, 5 quasi-experimental, 5 observational, 52 case studies, 23 surveys about wiki use, and 22 descriptive studies about the quality of information in wikis. We classified them by theme: patterns of use of CWAs (n=26), quality of information in existing CWAs (n=25), and CWAs as KT tools (n=73). A high prevalence of CWA use (ie, more than 50%) is reported in 58% (7/12) of surveys conducted with health care professionals and students. However, we found only one longitudinal study showing that CWA use is increasing in health care. Moreover, contribution rates remain low and the quality of information contained in different CWAs needs improvement. We identified 48 barriers and 91 facilitators in 4 major themes (factors related to the CWA, users&#8217; knowledge and attitude towards CWAs, human environment, and organizational environment). We also found 57 positive and 23 negative effects that we classified into processes and outcomes. Conclusions: Although we found some experimental and quasi-experimental studies of the effectiveness and safety of CWAs as educational and KT interventions, the vast majority of included studies were observational case studies about CWAs being used by health professionals and patients. More primary research is needed to find ways to address the different barriers to their use and to make these applications more useful for different stakeholders.

A large sample of British adolescent participants (n = 1004) aged 14 and 15 years and an equal number of their carers were interviewed. Young people provided reports of their recent gaming experiences. Further, the violent contents of these games were coded using official EU and US ratings, and carers provided evaluations of their adolescents' aggressive behaviours in the past month. Following a preregistered analysis plan, multiple regression analyses tested the hypothesis that recent violent game play is linearly and positively related to carer assessments of aggressive behaviour. Results did not support this prediction, nor did they support the idea that the relationship between these factors follows a nonlinear parabolic function. There was no evidence for a critical tipping point relating violent game engagement to aggressive behaviour. Sensitivity and exploratory analyses indicated these null effects extended across multiple operationalizations of violent game engagement and when the focus was on another behavioural outcome, namely, prosocial behaviour. The discussion presents an interpretation of this pattern of effects in terms of both the ongoing scientific and policy debates around violent video games, and emerging standards for robust evidence-based policy concerning young people's technology use.","2019","2019-02-22 13:24:04","2019-02-22T13:24:04Z","2019-02-13 13:51:58","171474","","2","6","","Royal Society Open Science","Violent video game engagement is not associated with adolescents' aggressive behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
